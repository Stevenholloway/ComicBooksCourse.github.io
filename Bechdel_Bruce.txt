AND SMALL, MULLIONED WINDOWS, SIX PANES OVER NINE. AFTER THE FLOOD OF 1865, IT WAS RADICALLY ALTERED BY THE NEW OWNER INTO A GOTHIC REVIVAL COTTAGE STYLE…THIS OWNER CHANGED THE ROOFS, THE PORCHES, THE CHIMNEYS, THE FIREPLACES, THE WALLS, THE WOODWORK, UNTIL IT BECAME A STYLISH TOWN HOUSE SUITABLE FOR A PROSPEROUS LAWYER’S FAMILY. PROCEEDING TO THE EAST PARLOR, WITH ITS BOLDLY SCROLLED ROCOCO PAPERS AND ITS BORDERED WALL-TO-WALL CARPET, YOU WILL SEE THE SHOWPLACE ROOM OF THE HOUSE…RUB HER BACK FOR HER…AND SMALL MULLIONED WINDOWS. JUST WRITE DOWN WHAT’S HAPPENING. IN THE BACK DISPLAY ROOM IS A FINE, CHERRY HEPPLEWHITE CORNER CUPBOARD OF ABOUT 1790. THIS WAS DONATED BY THE KLECKNER FAMILY OF SUGAR VALLEY. ON THE WALL ARE KITCHEN TOOLS USED BY EARLY FARM FAMILIES IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. I’M BAD. NOT GOOD LIKE YOU. HEY, MARK. WHERE’S YOUR BROTHER? GET IN, WE’LL GO FIND HIM. TO DANVILLE.

AND WHAT ABOUT LIZZIE AND HER FATHER? BARNER?  YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE IN THAT CLASS WORTH TEACHING.  OKAY, LETS TALK ABOUT HOW THE SUN ALSO RISES.  ITS A ROMAN A CLEF, RIGHT?  JAKE IS HEMINGWAY.  COHN WAS A GUY NAMED HAROLD LOEB.  BRETT IS A LADY DUFF TWYSDEN.  THEY SAY SHE STARTED THE NEW LOOK FOR WOMEN, WITH SHORT HAIR AND MENS CLOTHES.  AND SHE REALLY DID HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH LOEB BEFORE MEETING UP WITH HIM AND HEMINGWAY IN PAMPLONA.  YOU KNOW ANDY, THE BEST MAN AT OUR WEDDING, SAW HEMINGWAY IN PAMPLONA THE YEAR BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.  HE’D JUST COME FROM PARIS WHERE HE WAS HANGING OUT WITH SYLVIA BEACH AND JAMES JOYCE.

I’M HER FATHER.
