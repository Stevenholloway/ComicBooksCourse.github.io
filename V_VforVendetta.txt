“THE MULTIPLYING VILLAINIES OF NATURE DO SWARM UPON HIM...” “AND FORTUNE, ON HIS DAMNED QUARREL, SMILING, SHOWED LIKE A REBEL’S WHORE.” “BUT ALL’S TOO WEAK; FOR BRAVE MACBETH...WELL HE DESERVES THAT NAME...” “DISDAINING FORTUNE, WITH HIS BRANDISHED STEEL,”WHICH SMOKED WITH BLOODY EXECUTION. “LIKE VALOUR’S MINION, CARVED OUT HIS PASSAGE... ...”TILL HE FACED THE SLAVE; “WHICH NE’ER SHOOK HANDS, “NOR BADE FAREWELL TO HIM.” ME? I’M THE KING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. I’M THE BOGEYMAN. THE VILLAIN. ...THE BLACK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY. AHH, BUT TONIGHT IS SPECIAL .  TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION. A GRAND OPENING. WERE YOU NEVER TAUGHT THE RHYME? “REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER, THE GUNPOWDER TREASON AND PLOT. I KNOW OF NO REASON WHY THE GUNPOWDER TREASON... ...SHOULD EVER BE FORGOT.” I DID THAT. I REALLY DID THAT. NOW HUSH THERE’S MORE... THERE. THE OVERTURE IS FINISHED. COME. WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE FIRST ACT... WE ARE I THE SHADOW GALLERY. THIS IS MY HOME.DO YOU LIKE IT? I BUILT IT MYSELF YOU KNOW. YOU COULDN’T BE EXPECTED TO KNOW. THEY HAVE ERADICATED CULTURE... TOSSED IT AWAY LIKE A FISTFUL OF DEAD ROSES... ALL THE BOOKS, ALL THE FILMS... ALL THE MUSIC... IT’S NOT. AND THE WORD IS “JUKE-BOX.” WITH A “J.” THE SONG IS CALLED “DANCING IN THE STREETS.” IT’S BEING SUNG BY MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS, PERHAPS THE TERM “TAMLA MOTOWN” IS FAMILIAR TO YOU? OBVIOUSLY NOT. HARDLY SURPRISING, I SUPPOSE AFTER ALL... ...THEY ERADICATED SOME CULTURES MORE THOROUGHLY THAN THEY DID OTHERS. NO TAMLA AND NO TROJAN. NO BILLIE HOLIDAY OR BLACK UHURU... JUST HIS MASTER’S VOICE. EVERY HOUR. ON THE HOUR. WE’LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT... HELLO. NOBODY EVER DOES. YOU’VE BEEN CRYING. I DON’T HAVE A NAME. YOU CAN CALL ME “V.” WHAT SHALL I CALL YOU? EVERYBODY IS SPECIAL. EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY IS A HERO, LOVER, A FOOL, A VILLAIN. EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR STORY TO TELL. EVEN EVEY HAMMOND. I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR EVEY HAMMOND’S STORY. SIXTEEN. THEN YOU WERE BORN IN 1981? THIS WAS DURING THE RECESSION IN THE EIGHTIES? AND THE WAR EVEY. DO YOU REMEMBER THE WAR? HUSH, CHILD, HUSH. IT’S OVER NOW. YOU’RE SAFE. THE PAST CAN’T HURT YOU ANYMORE. NOT UNLESS YOU LET IT. THEY MADE YOU INTO A VICTIM, EVEY. THEY MADE YOU INTO A STATISTIC. BUT THAT’S NOT THE REAL YOU. THAT’S NOT WHO YOU ARE INSIDE. JUST TRUST ME, EVEY, AND WE CAN WIPE IT ALL AWAY. ALL THE PAIN, ALL THE CRUELTY, ALL THE BEREAVEMENT. WE CAN START AGAIN. THERE, YOU SEE? ALL GONE. HMM? I’M A FUNNY PERSON, EVEY. YOU’LL FIND THAT OUT WHEN YOU’VE KNOWN ME LONGER. A VERY FUNNY PERSON INDEED. YOU AND ME, EVEY. YOU AND ME
 AGAINST THE WORLD! HA HA HA HA! MELODRAMA, EVEY! ISN’T IT STRANGE HOW LIFE TURNS INTO MELODRAMA? IT’S EVERYTHING, EVEY. THE PERFECT ENTRANCE, THE GRAND ILLUSION. IT’S EVERYTHING. ...AND I’M GOING TO BRING THE HOUSE DOWN. THEY’VE FORGOTTEN THE DRAMA OF IT ALL, YOU SEE. THEY ABANDONED THEIR SCRIPTS WHEN THE WORLD WITHERED IN THE GLARE OF THE NUCLEAR FOOTLIGHTS. I’M GOING TO REMIND THEM. ABOUT MELODRAMA. ABOUT THE TUPPENNY RUSH AND THE PENNY DREADFUL. YOU SEE, EVEY, ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE. AND EVERYTHING ELSE... ...IS VAUDEVILLE. GOOD MORNING, CAMPERS. UNIFORM ALL BRUSHED, PRESSED AND READY FOR DUTY, I SEE. GOOD MAN, COMMANDER PROTHERO. GOOD MAN. LET’S GET TO WORK, SHALL WE? THESE CONCENTRATION CAMPS...SORRY...THESE RESETTLEMENT CAMPS DON’T RUN THEMSELVES, DO THEY? LARKHILL 1993. I WAS THERE COMMANDER PROTHERO. LOOK SMART, COMMANDER. WE’VE GOT TO MAKE THE TOUR OF INSPECTION NOW. YOU REMEMBER... THE WAY YOU USED TO MAKE IT EVERY EVENING. BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS. ALL COMING BACK TO YOU, EH? THE MAIN BODY OF THE PRISONERS WOULD BE GATHERED IN THE YARD AWAITING YOUR INSPECTION... YOU SIMPLY HAD TO WALK FROM YOUR OFFICE DOWN PAST THE NISSEN HUTS, TURN THE CORNER... AND THERE THEY WERE... ADMIRABLE CONCERN, COMMANDER. YET IT’S DEUCED ODD, ISN’T IT? HOW YOU CAN SHOW SO MUCH CONCERN FOR PORCELAIN AND PLASTIC... ...AND SHOW SO LITTLE FOR FLESH AND BLOOD. DO YOU REMEMBER, COMMANDER? DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS PEOPLE GATHERED IN THE SORDID LITTLE ENCLOSURE? PEOPLE HALF DEAD WITH STARVATION AND DYSENTERY? PERFECTLY. COME ALONG, COMMANDER. YOUR TOUR ISN’T OVER YET. THERE ARE STILL THE SPECIAL PRISONERS TO SEE. THE ONES IN THE MEDICAL COMPOUND. JUST ALONG HERE IS WHERE YOU KEPT THE ONES WHO’D TAKEN PART IN YOUR SCIENTISTS’...EXPERIMENTS, I BELIEVE THEY USED TO CALL THEM. YOU HAD TO WALK PAST THIS ROW OF DOORS EVERY NIGHT. ROOM OE, ROOM TWO, ROOM THREE... ...ROOM FOUR... ROOM FIVE. I REMEMBER YOU USED TO CALL OUT TO US SOMETIMES. LITTLE JOKES. YOU HAD A SPECIAL NAME FOR THE MEDICAL BLOCK. YOU USED TO CALL IT THE FUNNY FARM. I REMEMBER WHAT A GOOD VOICE YOU HAD. I IMAGINE THAT’S WHY THEY PICKED YOU TO DO THE FATE BROADCASTS. A MAN OF MANY TALENTS, EH, COMMANDER? AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE WAS THAT OTHER LITTLE JOB YOU USED TO DO. THE OVENS, COMMANDER. YOU USED TO WORK THE OVENS. HELLO, DEAR LADY. A LOVELY EVENING, IS IT NOT? FORGIVE ME FOR INTRUDING. PERHAPS YOU WERE INTENDING TO TAKE A STROLL. PERHAPS YOU WERE MERELY ENJOYING THE VIEW. NO MATTER. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TIME WE HAD A LITTLE CHAT YOU
 AND I. AHH...I WAS FORGETTING THAT WE ARE NOT PROPERLY INTRODUCED. I DO NOT HAVE A NAME. YOU CAN CALL ME V. MADAM JUSTICE...THIS IS V. V...THIS IS MADAM JUSTICE. HELLO, MADAM JUSTICE. “GOOD EVENING, V.” THERE. NOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER. ACTUALLY, I’VE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. OH, I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING... “THE POOR BOY HAS A CRUSH ON ME...AN ADOLESCENT INFATUATION.” I BEG YOUR PARDON, MADAM. IT ISN’T LIKE THAT AT ALL. I’VE LONG ADMIRED YOU...ALBEIT ONLY FROM A DISTANCE. I USED TO STARE AT YOU FROM THE STREETS BELOW WHEN I WAS A CHILD. I’D SAT TO MY FATHER. “WHO IS THAT LADY?” AND HE’D SAY, “THAT’S MADAM JUSTICE.” AND I’D SAY, “ISN’T SHE PRETTY.” PLEASE DON’T THINK IT WAS MERELY PHYSICAL. I KNOW YOU’RE NOT THAT SORT OF GIRL. NO, I LOVED YOU AS A PERSON. AS AN IDEAL. THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I’M AFRAID THERE’S SOMEONE ELSE NOW... “WHAT? V! FOR SHAME! YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME FOR SOME HARLOT, SOME VAIN AND POUTING HUSSY WITH PAINTED LIPS AND A KNOWING SMILE!” I, MADAM? I BEG TO DIFFER! IT WAS YOUR INFIDELITY THAT DROVE ME TO HER ARMS! AH-HA! THAT SURPRISED YOU, DON’T IT? YOU THOUGHT I DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT YOUR LITTLE FLING. BUT I DO. I KNOW EVERYTHING! FRANKLY, I WASN’T SURPRISED WHEN I FOUND OUT. YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE AN EYE FOR A MAN IN UNIFORM. “UNIFORM? WHY, I’M SURE I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS ALWAYS YOU, V. YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE...” LIAR! SLUT! WHORE! DENY THAT YOU LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY WITH YOU, HIM WITH HIS ARM BANDS AND JACKBOOTS! WELL? CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE? I THOUGHT AS MUCH. VERY WELL. SO YOU STAND REVEALED AT LAST. YOU ARE NO LONGER MY JUSTICE. YOU ARE HIS JUSTICE NOW. YOU HAVE BEDDED ANOTHER. WELL, TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME. “SOB! CHOKE! WH-WHO IS SHE, V? WHAT IS HER NAME?” HER NAME IS ANARCHY. AND SHE HAS TAUGHT ME MORE AS A MISTRESS THAN YOU EVER DID! SHE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT JUSTICE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT FREEDOM. SHE IS HONEST. AND SHE MAKES SO PROMISES AND BREAKS NONE. UNLIKE YOU, JEZEBEL. I USED TO WONDER WHY YOU COULD NEVER LOOK AT ME IN THE EYE. NOW I KNOW. SO GOODBYE, DEAR LADY. I WOULD BE SADDENED BY OUR PARTING EVEN NOW, SAVE THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER THE WOMAN THAT I ONCE LOVED. HERE IS A FINAL GIFT. I LEAVE IT AT YOUR FEET. THE FLAMES OF FREEDOM. HOW LOVELY. AHH, MY PRECIOUS ANARCHY... “O BEAUTY, ‘TIL NOW I NEVER KNEW THEE.” EVEY EVEY EVEY EVEY. IT’S A QUOTATION. A MOTTO... “VI VERI VENIVERSUM VIVUS VICI.” “BY THE POWER OF TRUTH, I, WHILE LIVING, HAVE CONQUERED THE UNIVERSE.” LATIN. DOES THAT BOTHER YOU? NO DEALS, EVEY. NOT UNLESS YOU WANT THEM. IF YOU LIKE. I THINK I KNOW A WAY THAT YOU COULD HELP ME. VERY SOON. VERY SOON INDEED. YES, I THINK
 THAT WE CAN MAKE A DEAL. NOBODY YOU’D EVER HEARD OF. A GERMAN GENTLEMAN NAMED DR. JOHN FAUST. HE MADE A DEAL, TOO. “BRING ME MY BOW OF BURNING GOLD, BRING ME MY ARROWS OF DESIRE, BRING ME MY SPEAR, O CLOUDS UNFOLD, BRING ME MY CHARIOT OF FIRE... “I WILL NOT CEASE FROM MENTAL FIGHT... “NOR SHALL MY SWORD SLEEP IN MY HAND... “TILL WE HAVE BUILT JERUSALEM... “IN ENGLAND’S GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND.” PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF... I’M A MAN OF WEALTH... AND TASTE. I AM THE DEVIL, AND I COME TO DO THE DEVIL’S WORK. I DO NOT HAVE A NAME. YOU CAN CALL ME V. ...AND AT THE MOMENT THIS ENTERS YOUR MOUTH IT BECOMES THE FLESH OF THE SAVIOUR? AND WHATEVER IT IS MADE OF NOW IT WILL BECOME THE BODY OF CHRIST? I WANT YOU TO SWALLOW IT. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME? AND AS FOR ME INVOLVING YOU, I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE THE ONE ANXIOUS TO MAKE A DEAL. “THERE IS MORE BEHIND AND INSIDE V THAN ANY OF US HAD EXPECTED. NOT WHO, BUT WHAT IS SHE.” YOU’LL LEARN, EVEY. YOU’LL LEARN. “LET’S DIG AN ENORMOUS CASTLE!” CRIED MOON-FACE. “THEN WE CAN ALL SIT ON TOP OF IT WHEN THE SEA COMES IN.” “WE CAN’T,” SAID SILKY, SUDDENLY LOOKING SAD. “WHY NOT? WHY NOT?” CRIED JO IN SURPRISE. “ISN’T THIS THE LAND OF DO-AS-YOU-PLEASE?” “YES,” SAID SILKY. “BUT IT’S TIME WE WENT BACK TO THE FARAWAY TREE. THIS LAND WILL SOON BE MOVING ON--AND NICE AS IT IS, WE DON’T WANT TO LIVE HERE FOREVER.” “GRACIOUS NO.” SAID JO. “OUR MOTHER AND FATHER COULDN’T POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT US...” YES. ARE YOU AFRAID? THERE IS NO COINCIDENCE, DELIA. ONLY THE ILLUSION OF COINCIDENCE. I HAVE ANOTHER ROSE... IT’S FOR YOU. I KILLED YOU TEN MINUTES AGO. WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP. NO. NO PAIN. THEY SAY THAT THERE'S A BROKEN LIGHT FOR EVERY HEART ON BROADWAY. THEY SAY THAT LIFE'S A GAME, THEN THEY TAKE THE BOARD AWAY. THEY GIVE YOU MASKS AND COSTUMES AND AN OUTLINE OF THE STORY... THEN LEAVE YOU ALL TO IMPROVISE THEIR VICIOUS CABARET. IN NO-LONGER-PRETTY CITIES THERE ARE FINGERS IN KITTIES, THERE ARE WARRANTS, FORMS, AND CHITTIES AND A JACKBOOT ON THE STAIR... THERE’S SEX AND DEATH AND HUMAN GRIME IN MONOCHROME FOR ONE
THIN DIME, BUT AT LEAST THE TRAINS ALL RUN ON TIME BUT THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE. FACING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES EITHER ON THEIR BACKS OR ON THEIR KNEES, THERE ARE LADIES WHO JUST SIMPLY FREEZE AND DARE NOT TURN AWAY...AND THE WIDOWS THAT REFUSE TO CRY WILL BE DRESSED IN GARTER AND BOW-TIE AND BE TAUGHT TO KICK THEIR LEGS UP HIGH IN THIS VICIOUS CABARET. AT LAST THE 1998 SHOW! THE BALLET ON THE BURNING STAGE. THE DOCUMENTARY SEE UPON THE FRACTURED SCREEN THE DREADFUL POEM SCRAWLED UPON THE CRUMPLED PAGE! THERE'S A POLICEMAN WITH AN
 HONEST SOUL THAT HAS SEEN WHOSE HEAD IS ON THE POLE AND HE GRUNTS AND FILLS HIS BRIAR BOWL WITH A FEELING OF UNEASE. BUT HE BRISKLY FRISKS THE TORN REMAINS FOR A FINGERPRINT OR CRIMSON STAINS AND ENDEAVOURS TO IGNORE THE CHAINS THAT HE WALKS IN TO HIS KNEES. WHILE HIS MASTER IN THE DARK NEARBY INSPECTS THE HANDS, WITH A BRUTAL EYE, THAT HAVE NEVER BRUSHED A LOVER'S THIGH BUT HAVE SQUEEZED A NATION'S THROAT. BUT HE HUNGERS IN HIS SECRET DREAMS FOR THE HARSH EMBRACE OF CRUEL MACHINES BUT HIS LOVER IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS AND SHE WILL NOT LEAVE A NOTE. AT LAST THE 1998 SHOW! THE SITUATION TRAGEDY GRAND OPERA SLICK WITH SOAP CLIFFHANGERS WITH NO HOPE THE WATER-COLOUR IN THE FLOODED GALLERY. THERE'S A GIRL WHO'LL PUSH BUT NOT SHOVE AND IS DESPERATE FOR HER FATHER'S LOVE SHE BELIEVES THE HAND BENEATH THE GLOVE MAYBE ONE SHE NEEDS TO HOLD. THOUGH SHE DOUBTS HER HOSTS MORALITIES SHE DECIDES SHE IS MORE AT EASE IN THE LAND OF DOING WHAT YOU PLEASE THAN OUTSIDE IN THE COLD. BUT THE BACKDROPS PEEL AND THE SETS GIVE WAY AND THE CAST GETS EATEN BY THE PLAY THERE'S A MURDERER AT THE MATINEE, THERE ARE DEAD MEN IN THE AISLES AND THE PATRONS AND ACTORS TOO ARE UNCERTAIN IF THE SHOW IS THROUGH AND WITH SIDE-LONG LOOKS AWAIT THEIR CUE BUT THE FROZEN MASK JUST SMILES. AT LAST THE 1998 SHOW! THE TORCH-SONG NO ONE EVER SINGS THE CURFEW CHORUS LINE THE COMEDY DIVINE THE BULGING EYES OF PUPPETS STRANGLED BY THEIR STRINGS THERE'S THRILLS AND CHILLS AND GIRLS GALORE, SING-SONGS AND SURPRISES THERE'S SOMETHING HEAR FOR EVERYONE, RESERVE YOUR SEAT TODAY THERE'S MISCHIEF AND MALARKIES BUT NO QUEERS OR YIDS OR DARKIES... WITHIN THIS BASTARD'S CARNIVAL. THIS VICIOUS CABARET! AS YOU SEE, MY HANDS ARE QUITE EMPTY...CONCEALING NOTHING... ...NOR HAVE I ANYTHING UP MY SLEEVE. AND YET, WITH THE MEREST FLICK OF MY WRIST... THE RABBIT IS GONE! BRING HER BACK? BUT WHAT IF SHE IS CONTENT WHERE SHE IS? DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISTURB HER? AHH... BUT I SEE YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND. VERY WELL. WE REPLACE THE CLOTH... LIKE SO... AND WHEN NEXT WE WHISK IT AWAY... PRESTO! THE RABBIT HAS RETURNED! BUT NOW HER HOME IS GONE. YES? ...OR PERHAPS I’M YOUR FATHER? COME WITH ME EVEY. I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU... YOU’LL HAVE TO WEAR THIS, I’M AFRAID. DON’T WORRY... ...IT’S PART OF THE SURPRISE. THIS WAY... HUSH EVEY. AND LISTEN... GOOD EVENING, LONDON. I THOUGHT IT TIME WE HAD A LITTLE TALK. ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY? THEN I’LL BEGIN... I SUPPOSE YOU’RE WONDERING WHY I’VE CALLED YOU HERE THIS EVENING. WELL, YOU SEE, I’M NOT ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE LATELY... I’M AFRAID YOUR WORK’S
 BEEN SLIPPING, AND... ...AND, WELL, I’M AFRAID WE’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT LETTING YOU GO. OH, I KNOW. YOU’VE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY A LONG TIME NOW. ALMOST...LET ME SEE. ALMOST TEN THOUSAND YEARS! MY WORD, DOESN’T TIME FLY? IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY... I REMEMBER THE DAY YOU COMMENCED YOUR EMPLOYMENT, SWINGING DOWN FROM THE TREES, FRESH-FACED AND NERVOUS, A BONE CLASPED IN YOUR BRISTLING FIST... “WHERE DO I START, SIR?” YOU ASKED, PLAINTIVELY. I RECALL MY EXACT WORDS: “THERE’S A PILE OF DINOSAUR EGGS OVER THERE, YOUNGSTER,” I SAID, SMILING PATERNALLY THE WHILE. “GET SUCKING.” WELL, WE’VE CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN, HAVEN’T WE? AND YES, YES, YOU’RE RIGHT, IN ALL THAT TIME YOU HAVEN’T MISSED A DAY. WELL DONE, THOU GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT. ALSO, PLEASE DON’T THINK I’VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOUR OUTSTANDING SERVICE RECORD, OR ABOUT ALL THE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YOU’VE MADE TO THE COMPANY... FIRE, THE WHEEL, AGRICULTURE... IT’S AN IMPRESSIVE LIST, OLD-TIMER. A JOLLY IMPRESSIVE LIST. DON’T GET ME WRONG. BUT...WELL, TO BE FRANK, WE’VE HAD OUR PROBLEMS, TOO. THERE’S NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK A LOT OF IT STEMS FROM? I’LL TELL YOU... IT’S YOUR BASIC UNWILLINGNESS TO GET ON WITHIN THE COMPANY. YOU DON’T SEEM TO WANT TO FACE UP TO ANY REAL RESPONSIBILITY, OR TO BE YOUR OWN BOSS. LORD KNOWS, YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES... WE’VE OFFERED YOU PROMOTION TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND EACH TIME YOU’VE TURNED US DOWN. “I COULDN’T HANDLE THE WORK, GUV’NOR,” YOU WHEEDLED. “I KNOW MY PLACE.” TO BE FRANK, YOU’RE NOT TRYING, ARE YOU? YOU SEE, YOU’VE BEEN STANDING STILL FOR FAR TOO LONG, AND IT’S STARTING TO SHOW IN YOUR WORK... AND, I MIGHT ADD, IN YOUR GENERAL STANDARD OF BEHAVIOR. THE CONSTANT BICKERING ON THE FACTORY FLOOR HAS NOT ESCAPED MY ATTENTION... ...NOR THE RECENT BOUTS OF ROWDINESS IN THE STAFF CANTEEN. THEN OF COURSE THERE’S... HMM. WELL, I DIDN’T REALLY WANT TO HAVE TO BRING THIS UP, BUT... WELL, YOU SEE, I’VE BEEN HEARING SOME DISTURBING RUMORS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. NO, NEVER YOU MIND WHO TOLD ME. NO NAMES, NO PACK DRILL... I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET ON WITH YOUR SPOUSE. I HEAR THAT YOU ARGUE. I AM TOLD THAT YOU SHOUT. VIOLENCE HAS BEEN MENTIONED. I AM RELIABLY INFORMED THAT YOU ALWAYS HURT THE ONE YOU LOVE... ...THE ONE YOU SHOULDN’T HURT AT ALL. AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? IT’S ALWAYS THE CHILDREN WHO SUFFER, AS YOU’RE WELL AWARE. POOR LITTLE MITES. WHAT ARE THEY TO MAKE OF IT? WHAT ARE THEY TO MAKE OF YOUR BULLYING, YOUR DESPAIR, YOUR COWARDICE AND ALL YOUR FONDLY NURTURED BIGOTRIES? REALLY, IT’S NOT
 GOOD ENOUGH, IS IT? AND IT’S NO GOOD BLAMING THE DROP IN WORK STANDARDS UPON BAD MANAGEMENT, EITHER... ..THOUGH, TO BE SURE, THE MANAGEMENT IS VERY BAD. IN FACT, LET US NOT MINCE WORDS... THE MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE! WE’VE HAD A STRING OF EMBEZZLERS, FRAUDS, LIARS AND LUNATICS MAKING A STRING OF CATASTROPHIC DECISIONS. THIS IS PLAIN FACT. BUT WHO ELECTED THEM? IT WAS YOU! YOU WHO HAVE APPOINTED THESE PEOPLE! YOU WHO GAVE THEM THE POWER TO MAKE YOUR DECISIONS FOR YOU! WHILE I’LL ADMIT THAT ANYONE CAN MAKE A MISTAKE ONCE, TO GO ON MAKING THE SAME LETHAL ERRORS CENTURY AFTER CENTURY SEEMS TO ME NOTHING SHORT OF DELIBERATE. YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED THESE MALICIOUS INCOMPETENTS, WHO HAVE MADE YOUR WORKING LIFE A SHAMBLES. YOU HAVE ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION THEIR SENSELESS ORDERS. YOU HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO FILL YOUR WORKSPACE WITH DANGEROUS AND UNPROVEN MACHINES. YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED THEM. ALL YOU HAD TO SAY WAS “NO.” YOU HAVE NO SPINE. YOU HAVE NO SPINE. YOU ARE NO LONGER AN ASSET TO THE COMPANY. I WILL HOWEVER, BE GENEROUS. YOU WILL BE GRANTED TWO YEARS TO SHOW ME SOME IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR WORK. IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME YOU ARE STILL UNWILLING TO MAKE A GO OF IT... YOU’RE FIRED.THAT WILL BE ALL. YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR LABOURS. WELCOME HOME. BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. BECAUSE I WANT TO SET YOU FREE. IF THAT’S WHAT IT TAKES, EVEY. YOU WERE ALREADY IN A PRISON. YOU’VE BEEN IN A PRISON ALL YOUR LIFE.HAPPINESS IS A PRISON, EVEY. HAPPINESS IS THE MOST INSIDIOUS PRISON OF ALL. DON’T YOU? YOUR LOVER LIVED IN THE PENITENTIARY THAT WE ARE ALL BORN INTO, AND WAS FORCED TO RAKE THE DREGS OF THAT WORLD FOR HIS LIVING. HE KNEW AFFECTION AND TENDERNESS BUT ONLY BRIEFLY... EVENTUALLY, ONE OF THE OTHER INMATES STABBED HIM WITH A CUTLASS AND HE DROWNED UPON HIS OWN BLOOD. IS THAT IT, EVEY? IS THAT THE HAPPINESS WORTH MORE THAN FREEDOM? IT’S NOT AN UNCOMMON STORY, EVEY. MANY CONVICTS MEET WITH MISERABLE ENDS... YOUR MOTHER. YOUR FATHER. YOUR LOVER. ONE BY ONE. TAKEN OUT BEHIND THE CHEMICAL SHEDS... ...AND SHOT. ALL CONVICTS, HUNCHED AND DEFORMED BY THE SMALLNESS OF THEIR CELLS; THE WEIGHT OF THEIR CHAINS; THE UNFAIRNESS OF THEIR SENTENCES... I DIDN’T PUT YOU IN A PRISON, EVEY. I JUST SHOWED YOU THE BARS.YOU’RE IN A PRISON, EVEY. YOU WERE BORN IN A PRISON. YOU’VE BEEN IN A PRISON SO LONG, YOU NO LONGER BELIEVE THERE’S A WORLD OUTSIDE. THAT’S BECAUSE YOU’RE AFRAID, EVEY. YOU’RE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU CAN FEEL FREEDOM CLOSING IN ON YOU. YOU’RE AFRAID BECAUSE FREEDOM IS TERRIFYING... DON’T BACK AWAY FROM IT, EVEY. PART OF YOU UNDERSTANDS THE TRUTH EVEN AS PART
 PRETENDS NOT TO. WOMAN, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE. DON’T RUN FROM IT. GOOD. YOU’RE ALMOST THERE. GO CLOSER. FEEL THE SHAPE OF IT. YOUR MOTHER DIED. THEY TOOK YOUR FATHER AWAY. THERE’S A LITTLE GIRL, EVEY, AND SHE’S SCREAMING... YOU WERE IN A CELL, EVEY. THEY OFFERED YOU A CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH OF YOUR PRINCIPLES AND THE DEATH OF YOUR BODY. YOU SAID YOU’D RATHER DIE. YOU FACED THE FEAR OF YOUR OWN DEATH, AND YOU WERE CALM AND STILL. TRY TO FEEL NOW WHAT YOU FELT THEN...THE DOOR OF THE CAGE IS OPEN, EVEY. ALL THAT YOU FEEL IS THE WIND FROM OUTSIDE. DON’T BE AFRAID. TRY TO STAND. TRY TO WALK. THE LIFT WILL TAKE US UP TO THE ROOF. NO, EVEY. NO MORE BLINDFOLDS. ALL THE BLINDFOLDS ARE GONE. DO YOU FEEL IT? I KNOW. FIVE YEARS AGO, I TOO CAME THROUGH A NIGHT LIKE THIS, NAKED UNDER A ROARING SKY. THIS NIGHT IS YOURS. SEIZE IT. ENCIRCLE IT WITHIN YOUR ARMS. BURY IT IN YOUR HEART UP TO THE HILT... BECOME TRANSFIXED... BECOME TRANSFIGURED... FOREVER. ... THEN HE BRISKLY FRISKS THE TORN REMAINS FOR A FINGERPRINT OR CRIMSON STAINS AND ENDEAVORS TO IGNORE THE CHAINS THAT HE WALKS IN TO HIS KNEES. YOU DID IT ALL YOURSELF. I SIMPLY PROVIDED THE BACKDROP. THE DRAMA WAS ALL YOUR OWN. I DIDN’T WRITE THAT LETTER. PLEASE... COME WITH ME. VALERIE WROTE THE LETTER, IN HER OWN HAND, WHILE SHE LIVED. I DELIVERED IT TO YOU AS IT WAS DELIVERED TO ME. THE WORDS YOU WEPT OVER WERE THOSE THAT TRANSFORMED ME. FIVE YEARS EARLIER. I GREW THEM IN HER MEMORY. ... BUT I GIVE THEM TO OTHERS, UPON OCCASION. EVEY... ONCE YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD NOT KILL. NOT EVEN FOR ME. WHEN I PLUCKED YOU FROM THE STREETS YOU WERE ABOUT TO KILL A MAN. ONE ALISTAIR HARPER. HE KILLED YOUR LOVER. YOU WANTED REVENGE. THERE IS A ROSE HERE FOR HIM. YOU ONLY HAVE TO PLUCK IT AND HAND IT TO ME. NOTHING ELSE. TO PICK A FLOWER IS NOT A LARGE THING. UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING OFFERED HERE, AND DO AS THOU WILT. IT IS EASY AS IT IS IRREVOCABLE. NEXT? THE FINALE, I THINK. I THINK THE FINALE IS NEXT. OH YES, YOU’LL BE NEEDED. ... BUT NOT UNTIL THE VERY END. THAT WILL BE SOONER THAN YOU THINK. YOU MUST PREPARE YOURSELF. YOU’LL KNOW WHEN IT COMES. ME? I’M GOING TO GIVE THE WORLD WHAT VALERIE WANTED IT TO HAVE... ROSES. A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF ROSES. SHALL WE DANCE? SPRING CLEANING, EVE? IN NOVEMBER? OH YES. ALL THE TIME. YES? DON’T WORRY, EVE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY... “IT’LL ALL BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS.” THE ENDING IS NEARER THAN YOU THINK, AND IT IS ALREADY WRITTEN. ALL THAT WE HAVE LEFT TO CHOOSE IS THE CORRECT MOMENT TO BEGIN. GOOD EVENING, LONDON, THIS IS THE VOICE OF FATE. ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO TONIGHT, A GREAT CITIZEN MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT
 CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON CULTURE. IT WAS A CONTRIBUTION FORGED IN STEALTH AND SILENCE AND SECRECY, ALTHOUGH IT IS BEST REMEMBERED IN NOISE AND BRIGHT LIGHT. TO COMMEMORATE THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF EVENINGS, HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IS PLEASED TO RETURN THE RIGHTS OF SECRECY AND PRIVACY TO YOU, ITS LOYAL SUBJECTS. FOR THREE DAYS, YOUR MOVEMENTS WILL NOT BE WATCHED... YOUR CONVERSATIONS WILL NOT BE LISTENED TO... AND “DO WHAT THOU WILT” SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW. GOD BLESS YOU... ... AND GOODNIGHT. A LATE SEVENTIES RADIO/ CASSETTE. YOU CAN TUNE THEM TO THE POLICE BAND, EVEN IN A BROADCASTING BLACKOUT. NO. THIS IS ONLY THE LAND OF TAKE-WHAT-YOU-WANT. ANARCHY MEANS “WITHOUT LEADERS”; NOT “WITHOUT ORDER.” WITH ANARCHY COMES AN AGE OF ORDNUNG, OF TRUE ORDER, WHICH IS TO SAY VOLUNTARY ORDER. THIS AGE OF ORDNUNG WILL BEGIN WHEN THE MAD AND INCOHERENT CYCLE OF VERWIRRUNG THAT THESE BULLETINS REVEAL HAS RUN ITS COURSE. THIS IS NOT ANARCHY, EVE. THIS IS CHAOS. HOW DID YEATS PUT IT... ? “TURNING AND TURNING IN THE WIDENING GYRE, THE FALCON CANNOT HEAR THE FALCONER. THINGS FALL APART... “... THE CENTRE CANNOT HOLD.” INVOLUNTARY ORDER BREEDS DISSATISFACTION, MOTHER OF DISORDER; PARENT OF THE GUILLOTINE. AUTHORITARIAN SOCIETIES ARE LIKE FORMATION SKATING. INTRICATE, MECHANICALLY PRECISE AND ABOVE ALL, PRECARIOUS. BENEATH CIVILISATION’S FRAGILE CRUST, COLD CHAOS CHURNS... ... AND THERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE ICE IS TREACHEROUSLY THIN. AUTHORITY’S COLLAPSE SENDS CRACKS THROUGH BEDROOM, BOARDROOM, CHURCH AND SCHOOL ALIKE. ALL IS MISRULE. EQUALITY AND FREEDOM ARE NOT LUXURIES TO LIGHTLY CAST ASIDE. WITHOUT THEM, ORDER CANNOT LONG ENDURE BEFORE APPROACHING DEPTHS BEYOND IMAGINING. THIS IS MY SECRET LOVE NEST, EVE. I’M TAKING YOU TO MEET MY MISTRESS. IT IS A TANGLED AND UNHAPPY TALE OF HEARTS BETRAYED AND LOYALTIES MISPLACED. IT WAS NOT I THAT STRAYED. MY LOVE WAS JUSTICE, AND, INFATUATED WITH HER TRUTH AND LOVELINESS, I WORSHIPPED HER. ... UNTIL, BEHIND MY BACK, SHE TOOK UP WITH A MAN WHO VIOLATED AND ABUSED HER; SOMEONE FIERCE AND BRUTAL. WITH BURNED CHILDREN ON HIS BREATH. HE CHANGED HER. SHE REQUIRED A TASTE FOR LEATHER, CHAINS AND WHIPS. THE JUSTICE THAT I LOVED WAS GONE; WHO HAD SUCH KINDLY EYES; WHO TOOK SUCH SMALL AND CAREFUL STEPS... TRANSFORMED, SHE GLARED THROUGH NARROW SLITS AND GROUND GOOD MEN BENEATH HER VISCOUS HEEL. IMAGINE WHEN I LEARNED OF HER AFFAIR. MY ANGER AND MY SHAME TO THINK HOW THEY’D MADE MOCK OF ALL THAT I LOVED. MY JUSTICE AND HER BEASTIAL SWAIN, CAVORTING IN THEIR
 BLOODSTAINED SHEETS. STILL, ALL IN LOVE AND WAR IS FAIR, THEY SAY. THIS BEING BOTH, AND TURNABOUT’S FAIR PLAY. THOUGH I MUST BEAR A CUCKOLD’S HORNS, THEY’RE NOT A CROWN THAT I SHALL BEAR ALONE. YOU SEE, MY RIVAL, THOUGH INCLINED TO ROAM, POSSESSED AT HOME A WIFE THAT HE ADORED. HE’LL RUE HIS PROMISCUITY, THE ROGUE WHO STOLE MY ONLY LOVE, WHEN HE’S INFORMED HOW MANY YEARS IT IS... ... SINCE FIRST I BETTED HIS. SEE FOR YOURSELF. THE PIECES ARE SET OUT BEFORE ME, PERFECTLY ALIGNED. COMPLETE, ONE MAY AT LAST GRASP THEIR DESIGN; THEIR GRAND SIGNIFICANCE. ... BUT “ALMOST FINISHED” ...? YES. YES, I SUPPOSE I AM. THOUGH RECOGNITION’S HAS BEEN DELAYED BY ITS CIRCUITOUS CONSTRUCTION, NOW THE PATTERN LONG CONCEALED EMERGES INTO VIEW. IS IT NOT FINE? IS IT NOT SIMPLE, AND ELEGANT AND SEVERE? HOW STRANGE. AFTER THE LONG EXACTING TOIL OF PREPARATION THAT IT TAKES ONLY THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT AND LESS THOUGHT TO START THIS BRIEF, ELABORATE AMUSEMENT ON ITS BREATHLESS, HURDLING RACE: THE MEREST TOUCH, NO MORE... ... AND EVERYTHING FALLS INTO PLACE. THE PIECES CAN’T PERCEIVE AS WE THE MISCHIEF THEIR ARRANGEMENT TEMPTS: THOSE STOLID, LAW-ABIDING QUEUES, SO PREGNANT WITH CATASTROPHE. INSENSIBLE BEFORE THE WAVE SO SOON RELEASED BY CALLOUS FATE. AFFECTED MOST, THEY UNDERSTAND THE LEAST... ... AND UNDERSTANDING, WHEN IT COMES, INVARIABLY ARRIVES TOO LATE. INDEED, THEY’LL NOT KNOW ANYTHING’S AMISS UNTIL THEY’RE CAUGHT UP IN THAT TERRIBLE MOMENTUM, POSSIBLE MISTAKING IT AT FIRST FOR BOLD DECISIVE ACTION, SOME LAST MINUTE RALLY TO AVERT DISASTER, CHARGING TO THE RESCUE... ... BUT THEY ARE NOT CHARGING. THEY ARE FALLING. POOR LITTLE THINGS. THERE... YOU SEE THEM? STANDING WITH THEIR NUMBERS ON THEIR BLANK, INDIFFERENT FACES, NUREMBERG IN MINIATURE. THE RANKS OF PAINTED WOODEN MEN POOR DOMINOES. YOUR PRETTY EMPIRE TOOK SO LONG TO BUILD, NOW, WITH A SNAP OF HISTORY’S FINGERS... ... DOWN IT GOES. THE CHAOS PROGRESSES SPLENDIDLY WITHOUT US, EVE. FOR MY PART, I RATHER THINK THE TIME HAS COME FOR PUTTING CERTAIN THINGS TO ORDER. DO WHAT THOU WILT, EVE. THAT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW. YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU MY WILL? VERY WELL... VERY WELL, THEN. THIS WAY. NOT AT ALL. I’VE BEEN TEACHING YOU TO BREATHE. THIS WAY. REGARD THE AIR OF KNOWLEDGE HERE CONDENSED TO LIQUID ELECTRICITY. THE FACTS OF ALL SOCIETY ARE CENTRALIZED HEREIN... A FACT THAT’S FIGURED IN SOCIETY’S UNDOING... ... FOR I HAVE TAPPED THEIR KNOWLEDGE-WELL. SOON, EVERYONE SHALL DRINK. ... AND FATE IS LINKED TO EVERYTHING. IN A BUREAUCRACY, THE FILE CARDS ARE REALITY. PUNCHING NEW HOLES, WE RECREATE THE WORLD. THIS WAY.
 EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALL YOUR HERITAGE. IT INCLUDES ALSO COURAGE AND BELIEF, LIKE HERS THAT WE COMMEMORATE HEREIN... ... AND ROMANCE. ALWAYS, ALWAYS ROMANCE. ‘MIDST INSURRECTION’S CLAMOR, WE MAY EASILY FORGET JUST WHAT IT IS FOR WHICH WE STRIVE... ISN’T IT DANCING? SCENTED SHOULDERS? PUPILS WIDENED BY DESIRE OR WINE? ANARCHY MUST EMBRACE THE DIN OF BOMBS AND CANNON-FIRE... ... YET ALWAYS MUST IT LOVE SWEET MUSIC MORE.PERSEVERE, EVE. UNDERSTANDING MUSIC, WE MAY HEAR THE MUSIC THAT THERE IS IN LIFE, FROM ITS FIRST INSUFFICIENT TRILLS... ... UNTO ITS CLOSING MINOR CHORDS. INDEED. IMAGINE WE’RE INSIDE YOUR MIND,EACH ARE WITH ITS SKILLS AND FUNCTIONS: KNOWLEDGE, PLEASURE, CREATIVITY... ALL THAT REMAINS, THEN, IS TO MAKE THE PROPER NEURAL CONNECTIONS. UP THERE, THE HIGHER ATTRIBUTES OF REASON, LOVE AND CULTURE ARE CONTAINED. DOWN HERE, THE SHADOW GALLERY HAS EYES. UNERRINGLY. BUT COME... HERE’S SOMETHING THAT YOU’VE NEVER SEEN... ... INDEED, FEW MEN HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO STUDY THEIR OWN OPTIC NERVES. OH NO, THE MONITOR CAMERAS ARE STILL FUNCTIONING, BUT OUR ADVERSARIES’ BROADCASTING AND RECEIVING APPARATUS ISN’T. MY APPARATUS, BY CONTRAST, WORKS PERFECTLY. OF COURSE, WITH ALL STATE BROADCASTING BLANKED OUT, THE ONLY THINGS I SEEM TO GET ARE ALL THESE RIOT-ZONE SOAP OPERAS AND BAD DISASTER MOVIES. SOMETIMES I MISS “STORM SAXON.” THE DIALOGUE WAS BETTER. UNLIKE T.V., WE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH OF SCIENCE, DESPITE ITS NUCLEAR QUIRKS. WITH SCIENCE, IDEAS CAN GERMINATE WITHIN A BED OF THEORY, FORM, AND PRACTICE THAT ASSISTS THEIR GROWTH... BUT WE, AS GARDENERS, MUST BEWARE... FOR SOME SEEDS ARE THE SEEDS OF RUIN... ... AND THE MOST IRIDESCENT BLOOMS ARE OFTEN THE MOST DANGEROUS. OH NO, NOT HERE. FOR HIM, I’VE CULTIVATED A MOST SPECIAL ROSE. COME... LET US LEAVE THIS SCENTED BOWER. I TRUST YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. OH YES, YOU’LL COME TO KNOW THIS PLACE, IN ALL ITS LENGTHS AND DEPTHS. NOT SO MUCH A FLOOR, BUT MORE A MEZZANINE. THERE ARE THINGS STORED HERE THAT WE’LL SOON HAVE NEED OF FARTHER DOWN. THERE’S BUT ONE FLOOR TO GO, IF YOU COULD CARRY ONE OF THESE SMALL PARCELS, I’D BE GRATEFUL... BUT TAKE CARE GELIGNITE. DISPOSE OF IT. AFTER ALL, AS YOU POINT OUT, YOU WON’T BE NEEDING IT. ANARCHY WEARS TWO FACES, BOTH CREATOR AND DESTROYER. THUS DESTROYERS TOPPLE EMPIRES; MAKE A CANVAS OF CLEAN RUBBLE WHERE CREATORS CAN BUILD A BETTER WORLD. RUBBLE, ONCE ACHIEVED, MAKES FURTHER RUINS’ MEANS IRRELEVANT. AWAY WITH OUR EXPLOSIVES, THEN! AWAY WITH OUR DESTROYERS! THEY HAVE NO PLACE WITHIN OUR BETTER WORLD. BUT LET US
RAISE A TOAST TO ALL OUR BOMBERS, ALL OUR BASTARDS, MOST UNLOVELY AND MOST UNFORGIVABLE. LET’S DRINK THEIR HEALTH... ... THEN MEET WITH THEM NO MORE. HUSH. PLEASE... SHOW SOME REVERENCE. COME, LET US BE DISCREET AND PLACE THE GELIGNITE BEHIND THE LILIES... YOU ASKED ME TO REVEAL MY WILL. I HAVE DONE SO. NO. I HAVE TO STAY IN. I’M WAITING. NOT FOR WHAT. FOR WHOM. I’M WAITING FOR THE MAN. SO, MR. FINCH... FINALLY WE MEET. THERE. DID YOU THINK TO KILL ME? THERE’S NO FLESH OR BLOOD WITHIN THIS CLOAK TO KILL. THERE’S ONLY AN IDEA. IDEAS ARE BULLETPROOF. FAREWELL. EVE... EVE... EVE, LISTEN CAREFULLY. THE ONE I WAITED FOR HAS CALLED, AND NOW I HAVE NOT LONG. NO... I’D BE DEAD ERE YOU RETURNED, AND THERE ARE THINGS YOU MUST KNOW... THIS COUNTRY IS NOT SAVED... DO NOT THINK THAT... BUT ALL ITS OLD BELIEFS HAVE COME TO RUBBLE, AND FROM RUBBLE MAY WE BUILD... THAT IS THEIR TASK: TO RULE THEMSELVES; THEIR LIVES AND LOVES AND LAND... WITH THIS ACHIEVED, THEN LET THEM TALK OF SALVATION. WITHOUT IT, THEY ARE SURELY CARRION. BY TURN OF CENTURY THEY’LL KNOW THEIR FATE: EITHER A ROSE MIDST RUBBLE BLOOMS, OR ELSE HAS BLOOMED TOO LATE. BUT WHAT OF YOU, CHILD, NOW I’M DEAD? HUSH. FIRST, YOU MUST DISCOVER WHOSE FACE LIES BEHIND THIS MASK, BUT YOU MUST NEVER KNOW MY FACE. IS THAT QUITE CLEAR? ... ALSO... THE VICTORIA LINE IS BLOCKED... TWIXT WHITEHALL AND ST. JAMES... GIVE ME A VIKING FUNERAL... AYE... ATQUE... VALE...
