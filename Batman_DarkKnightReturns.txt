I’VE GOT THE HOME STRETCH ALL
TO MYSELF WHEN THE READINGS
STOP MAKING SENSE. I SWITCH TO
MANUAL-- --BUT THE COMPUTER
CROSSES ITS OWN CIRCUITS AND
REFUSES TO LET GO. I COAX IT. IT SHOVES HOT NEEDLES IN MY FACE AND TRIES TO MAKE ME BLIND. I’M IN CHARGE NOW AND I LIKE IT. THEN THE FRONT END LURCHES, ALL WRONG. I KNOW WHAT’S COMING. I’VE GOT JUST UNDER TWO SECONDS TO SHUT THIS MESS DOWN AND FORFEIT THE RACE. THE ENGINE,
 ANGRY, ARGUES THE POINT WITH ME. THE FINISH LINE IS CLOSE, IT ROARS. TOO CLOSE. THE LEFT FRONT TIRE DECIDES TO TURN ALL ON ITS OWN, I LAUGH AT IT AND JERK THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT. THE NOSE DIGS UP A CHUNK OF MACADAM. I LOOK AT IT-- --THEN STRAIGHT INTO THE EYE OF THE SUN. THIS WOULD BE A GOOD DEATH... ...BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT’S GOOD THAT HE RETIRED—ISN’T IT? HE DIDN’T. BUT BRUCE WAYNE IS...ALIVE AND WELL. NOT FOR SEVEN YEARS, JIM. YOU KNOW THAT. LET’S CALL IT A NIGHT JIM. AS WE PART, JIM SQUEEZES MY SHOULDER AND GRINS. “YOU JUST NEED A WOMEN,” HE SAYS. ...WHILE IN MY GUT THE CREATURE WRITHES AND SNARLS AND TELLS ME WHAT I NEED... I LEAVE MY CAR IN THE LOT. I CAN’T STAND TO BE INSIDE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. I WALK THE STREETS OF THIS CITY I’M LEARNING TO HATE, THE CITY THAT’S GIVEN UP, LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE. I’M A ZOMBIE. A FLYING DUTCHMAN. A DEAD MAN, TEN YEARS DEAD...I’LL FEEL BETTER IN THE MORNING. AT LEAST, I’LL FEEL IT LESS... IT’S THE NIGHT—WHEN THE CITY’S SMELLS CALL OUT TO HIM, THOUGH I LIE BETWEEN SILK SHEETS IN A MILLION-DOLLAR MANSION MILES AWAY... ...WHEN A POLICE SIREN WAKES ME, AND, FOR A MOMENT I FORGET THAT IT’S ALL OVER... BUT BATMAN WAS A YOUNG MAN. IF IT WAS REVENGE HE WAS AFTER, HE’S TAKEN IT. IT’S BEEN FORTY YEARS SINCE HE WAS BORN... ...BORN HERE. ONCE AGAIN, HE’S BROUGHT ME BACK—TO SHOW ME HOW LITTLE IT HAS CHANGED. IT’S OLDER, DIRTIER, BUT-- -- IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED YESTERDAY. IT COULD BE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THEY COULD BE LYING AT YOUR FEET, TWITCHING, BLEEDING... ...AND THE MAN WHO STOLE ALL SENSE FROM YOUR LIFE, HE COULD BE STANDING... ...RIGHT OVER THERE... IT IS HIM, IT IS. AND WE KNOW SO MANY WAYS TO HURT HIM... SO MANY LOVELY WAYS TO PUNISH HIM... NO, IT’S NOT HIM. SO MANY... NOT HIM. HE FLINCHED WHEN HE PULLED THE TRIGGER. HE WAS SICK AND GUILTY OVER WHAT HE DID. ALL HE WANTED WAS MONEY. I WAS NAIVE ENOUGH TO THINK HIM THE LOWEST SORT OF MAN. THESE—THESE ARE HIS CHILDREN. A PURER BREED... ...AND THE WORLD IS THEIRS. ...FASTER THAN A RABBIT... FASTER THAN A RABBIT, MOM! JUST WATCH! WON’T GET AWAY FROM ME... OOF! OWW! NO! GO WAY! GO WAY! THEN... SOMETHING SHUFFLES. OUT OF SIGHT... ...SOMETHING SUCKS THE STALE AIR... ...AND HISSES. GLIDING WITH ANCIENT GRACE... UNWILLING TO RETREAT AS HIS BROTHERS DID... EYES GLEAMING, UNTOUCHED BY LOVE OR JOY OR SORROW... BREATH HOW WITH THE TASTE OF FALLEN FOES... THE STENCH OF DEAD THINGS, DAMNED THINGS... SURELY THE FIERCEST SURVIVOR—THE PUREST WARRIOR... GLARING, HATING... ...CLAIMING ME AS HIS OWN. DREAMING... I WAS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD WHEN THAT HAPPENED. WHEN I FIRST SAW THE CAVE... ...HUGE, EMPTY, SILENT AS A CHURCH,
 WAITING, AS THE BAT WAS WAITING. AND NOW THE COBWEBS GROW AND THE DUST THICKENS IN HERE AS IT DOES IN ME-- --AND HE LAUGHS AT ME, CURSES ME. CALLS ME A FOOL. HE FILLS MY SLEEP, HE TRICKS ME. BRINGS ME HERE WHEN THE NIGHT IS LONG AND MY WILL IS WEAK. HE STRUGGLES RELENTLESSLY, HATEFULLY, TO BE FREE—I WILL NOT LET HIM. I GAVE MY WORD. FOR JASON. NEVER. NEVER AGAIN. HARDLEY ALFRED. SORRY TO WAKE YOU. THAT WILL BE ALL, ALFRED. GOOD NIGHT. ZORRO. I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED THE LISTINGS. I SHOULD TURN IT OFF—RIGHT THIS SECOND-- --JUST A MOVIE. THAT’S ALL IT IS. NO HARM IN WATCHING A MOVIE... YOU LOVED IT SO MUCH...YOU JUMPED AND DANCED LIKE A FOOL...YOU REMEMBER... ...YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT—...CHILDREN WERE LAST SEEN WITH TWO YOUNG MEN... ...WHO WERE DRESSED IN THE DISTINCTIVE COSTUME OF THE MUTANT GANG... THE TIME HAS COME. YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR SOUL. FOR I AM YOUR SOUL... YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME... YOU ARE PUNY, YOU ARE SMALL—YOU ARE NOTHING—A HOLLOW SHELL, A RUSTY TRAP THAT CANNOT HOLD ME—SMOLDERING, I BURN YOU—BURNING YOU, I FLARE, HOT AND BRIGHT AND FIERCE AND BEAUTIFUL—YOU CANNOT STOP ME—NOT WITH WINE OR VOWS OR THE WEIGHT OF AGE—YOU CANNOT STOP ME BUT STILL YOU TRY—STILL YOU RUN—YOU TRY TO DROWN ME OUT... ...BUT YOUR VOICE IS WEAK... THIS SHOULD BE AGONY. I SHOULD BE A MASS OF ACHING MUSCLE—BROKEN, SPENT, UNABLE TO MOVE. AND, WERE I AN OLDER MAN, I SURELY WOULD... ...BUT I’M A MAN OF THIRTY-- OF TWENTY AGAIN. THE RAIN ON MY CHEST IS A BAPTISM—I’M BORN AGAIN... I SMELL THEIR FEAR—AND IT IS SWEET. THESE MEN ARE MINE! FOUR OF THEM. ONE IN THE CAR, LEG BROKEN, IN SHOCK. OTHER THREE ARE ARMED—AND SMART ENOUGH TO HANG CLOSE TOGETHER. BUT THEY’RE SCARED. OLD ENOUGH TO NEED MY LEGS TO CLIMB A ROPE... THEY’RE FAST. SHOULDN’T HAVE GONE SO EASY ON THEM IN THE CAR. WELCOME TO HELL. THE LAST OWES USUALLY THE ONE TO LOSE IT. SO I LET HIM. AND I LET HIM COME TO ME. THEN I HEAR THE ROOKIE’S FOOT-STEPS, COMING UP FAST BEHIND ME. I’LL HAVE TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING KILLED. THE ROOKIE’S SAFE FOR THE FIVE SECONDS IT WILL TAKE HIM TO FIND HIS PISTOL. I PLAY THE SHADOWS, FORCING THE HOOD TO COME CLOSE. HE MAKES LESS NOISE THAN A TRUCK. THERE ARE SEVEN WORKING DEFENSES FROM THIS POSITION. THREE OF THEM DISARM WITH MINIMAL CONTACT. THREE OF THEM KILL. THE OTHER-- --HURTS. LET’S SEE WHAT YOU’VE GOT. CIGARETTES, NO WONDER YOU’RE SO SLOW... OH CHRIST I CAN’T STAND IT... IT ISN’T IN THE CAR. IT’S NOWHERE AROUND HERE. PILLS. NO END TO YOUR BAD HABITS... IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. AT THE BANK—WAS THERE A SECOND CAR? YOU WEREN’T SUPPOSED TO. TELL GORDON WE HAVE TO TALK. AAAHH! EASY,
 ALFRED. EASY. HELLO COMMISSIONER? NO, I’M JUST FINE... THAT IS INTERESTING. RELEASING HIM NOW, ARE YOU? SHUT UP, ALFRED. THE ROOM IS SPLIT BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK, CLEAN AND DIRTY. BUT THE SPLIT ISN’T EVEN—IT FAVORS THE DIRTY. IT’S AS IF THE DARK SIDE IS CLAIMING THE ROOM... AS IT CLAIMED THE COIN... YOUR BOSS LEFT. HE KNEW I’D TRACK HIM. IF HE IS HARVEY DENT, HE’S A MENACE TO EVERY LIFE IN GOTHAM. I KNOW YOU’RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. YOU’RE GOING TO TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, SOONER OR LATER. IF IT’S LATER-- --I WON’T MIND. YOU’VE GOT RIGHTS. LOTS OF RIGHTS. SOMETIMES I COUNT THEM JUST TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL CRAZY. BUT RIGHT NOW YOU’VE GOT A PIECE OF GLASS SHOVED INTO A MAJOR ARTERY IN YOUR ARM. RIGHT NOW YOU’RE BLEEDING TO DEATH. RIGHT NOW I’M THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD WHO CAN GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL IN TIME. THAT’S ALL HE KNEW JIM. ...SO IT’S JUST A MATTER OF FIGURING OUT WHAT HE’S AFTER. THEN IT’S GOING TO BE A CRIME BY AIR—USING SOMETHING ELSE MORE COSTLY. HE’S NOT CAREFUL, WHOEVER HE IS. I HOPE NOT. HARVEY WRESTLED LONG AND HARD WITH HIS OTHER SIDE. TO HAVE IT DEVOURS HIM NOW... IF IT’S HARVEY, WE’LL CATCH HIM... THE TRICK WILL BE TO KEEP HIM ALIVE. HE’S POSSESSED, JIM. OUT OF CONTROL. I THINK HE WANTS TO DIE. IT SHOULDN’T BE DIFFICULT TO FIND HIS TARGET. ACCESSIBLE BY HELICOPTER AND TWICE AS BIG AS... ...TWICE AS BIG ... ONE MORE TIME I CHECK MY UTILITY BELT. NERVE GAS AMPULES. FREEZING COMPOUND. CABLE. GRAPPLING HOOKS. STETHOSCOPE. PAIN KILLERS. NONE OF IT’S GONE ANYWHERE IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES. I SHIFT MY LEGS TO KEEP THEM FROM CRAMPING AND WATCH NIGHT SETTLE LIKE A CEASE FIRE ON THE CITY OF GOTHAM. THEN I HEAR IT. DENT—OR WHOEVER—IS SURE TO BE IN THE NEWER COPTER. I’M HOPING HE’LL LAND ON THE TOWER I PICKED... BUT I’M NOT COUNTING ON IT. THEY SPLIT. THE ARMY SURPLUS JOB SETTLES DOWN, SPUTTERING LIKE A CRANKY OLD MAN BEHIND ME. I PICKED THE WRONG ROOF. GOOD THING I BROUGHT THE GUN. THE NEW ONE COMES IN LOW, A GLEAMING METAL DRAGONFLY. I’LL HAVE TO BUY ONE OF THOSE...PAIN THAT’S THREE DAYS OLD CRAWLS ACROSS MY BACK. I KICK THE DUST FROM MY JOINTS AND CLIMB. IT USED TO BE EASIER. WHATEVER HE’S GOT IN MIND, HE WANTS IT PUBLIC—TOO BAD I CAN’T GIVE HIM MY ATTENTION. NOT JUST YET. THIS STUFF HAS A NAME THAT’S AS LONG AS YOUR ARM. IT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE MILITARY DURING ONE OF OUR MORE CONTEMPTIBLE WARS. IT CONCENTRATES A POWERFUL STIMULANT TO A SECTION OF THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF YOUR BRAIN. A STRONG DOSE AND YOU DIE OF FRIGHT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS. A LIGHT DOSE, LIKE THIS-- -- AND YOU SPEND TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES RELIVING YOUR LEAST FAVORITE NIGHTMARE. THE ONLY AFTER EFFECT I’VE NOTICED IS
 A MARKED AVERSION TO GUNS, KNIVES AND CRIME- FIGHTERS...AS I SUSPECT—A BOMB. WITH ENOUGH CHARGE TO DEMOLISH THE BUILDING. APPARENTLY A DETONATOR JOB. THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. WAIT—IF THOSE READINGS MEAN WHAT I THINK THEY DO... THE IGNITION PROCESS HAS ALREADY STARTED. IT COULD BLOW ANY SECOND. SOMEBODY WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF DISGUISING IT, BUT WHY? AND WHO? BRILLIANT DESIGN—WORTHY OF THE JOKER. I’M NOT UP ON THESE DIGITAL JOBS. SO I FREEZE IT. AND IF I HAD THE TIME OR THE RIGHT-- --I’D SAY A PRAYER. TEN SECONDS LATER BOTH THE BUILDING AND I ARE STANDING AND EXACTLY THAT MUCH IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. I TAKE IN THE ACTION ON THE OTHER SIDE HE’S TAPPED INTO THE TV ANTENNA—NO DOUBT RANSOMING THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS—WHILE THE TIMER HE DOESN’T KNOW ABOUT IS MOMENTS AWAY FROM TAKING IT ALL OUT OF HIS HANDS. HARVEY, IF IT IS YOU—YOU’VE HAD EVERY CHANCE THERE IS. IN TEN YEARS I’VE NEVER FELT SO CALM. SO RIGHT. THIS WOULD BE A FINE DEATH... --MAGNUM LOAD HAS TO BE—HITS ME LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN—THE PLATE HOLDS— -- WHY DO YOU THINK I WEAR A TARGET ON MY CHEST-- CAN’T ARMOR MY HEAD—LEFT ARM NUMB-- -- IF IT’S A HEART ATTACK I’M FINISHED-- ...A FINE DEATH. BUT THERE ARE THE THOUSANDS TO THINK OF... ...AND HARVEY... ... I HAVE TO KNOW. HE’S GOT YOUR STYLE, HARVEY, AND YOUR GUTS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, HE’S GOT NO MORE SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION THAN YOU DID... ...AND INSPIRES THE SAME LEVEL OF LOYALTY FROM HIS MEN. IT TAKES NEARLY A MINUTE TO FALL FROM THIS HEIGHT. AND DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD, YOU’RE LIKELY TO STAY CONSCIOUS ALL THE WAY DOWN. THOUGHTS LIKE THAT KEEP ME WARM AT NIGHT. THE IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS EVEN BONE IS TURNED TO POWDER. NOT MUCH OF A CORPSE LEFT. MOSTLY LIQUID. PROBLEM IS... ...THERE MIGHT NOW BE ANY FINGER-PRINTS. EVEN DENTAL RECORDS WOULD PROBABLY BE USELESS. AND LIKE I SAID HARVEY... ...I HAVE TO KNOW. WE TUMBLE LIKE LOVERS. THE AIR IS COLD. THE NIGHT IS SILENT. LEAVING THE WORLD NO POORER-- --FOUR MEN DIE. ...HARVEY... THE SCARS GO DEEP, TOO DEEP... I CLOSE MY EYES AND LISTEN. NOT FOOLED BY SIGHT, I SEE HIM... AS HE IS. I SEE HIM. I SEE... ...I SEE... A REFLECTION, HARVEY. A REFLECTION. I BELIEVE YOU. DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM, PUNK? I’M THE WORST NIGHTMARE YOU EVER HAD, KIND THAT MADE YOU WAKE UP SCREAMING FOR YOUR MOTHER. YOU’VE GOT A MOTHER, DON’T YOU? EVERY PUNK SHOULD HAVE A MOTHER... QUITE AN ARSENAL YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES HAD... THE .45 WAS NOTHING SPECIAL, OF COURSE... ...BUT THAT SMITH & WESSON .41 YOUR PAL WAS CARRYING-- --YOU KNOW WHICH PAL, THE ONE YOU PERFORATED-- --THAT PISTOL WAS ODD. ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS ADAPTED FOR A SILENCER. YOU JUST DON’T RUN
 ACROSS THAT—NOT OUTSIDE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. BUT THAT MGO OF YOURS—THAT’S COMBAT WEAPONRY. SAME KIND ANOTHER MEMBER OF YOUR GANG TRIED TO USE ON JIM GORDON. SO FILL ME IN, PUNK—THE MUTANTS HAVE A WHOLESALE DEAL WITH THE ARMY? YOU’VE GOT A LOT OF TEETH LEFT. AND I HAVEN’T EVEN TOUCHED YOUR TONGUE... I DON’T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. YOU’RE NOT IN A POSITION TO NEGOTIATE. LET ME SHOW YOU... IT WAS TOUGH WORK, CARRYING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS OF SOCIOPATH TO THE TOP OF GOTHAM TOWERS—THE HIGHEST SPOT IN THE CITY. THE SCREAM ALONE IS WORTH IT. THE GENERAL’S RECORD IS AN ANTHEM OF ORDERS BARKED BETWEEN DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS... OF A STEELY, REASSURING VOICE ABOVE THE CRIES OF WOUNDED MEN... ...AN ANTHEM, SHATTERED INTO DISCORD IN ITS LAST FEW NOTES—BY MISAPPROPRIATED WEAPONS... SOLD TO THE MUTANTS. I ALMOST ASKED HIM WHY...THE GUARD AT GATE TWELVE IS NODDING OFF WHEN I FIND THE TRUCKS. THEY AREN’T EVEN LOCKED. YOU COULD OVERTHROW A SMALL GOVERNMENT WITH THIS MUCH FIREPOWER. IF IT'S WAR THEY WANT—I’VE GOT JUST THE THING... WHO ELSE. ALFRED? THAT’S RIGHT, ALFRED. I’M TAKING HER OUT.I HIT THE ENGINE. SHE RESPONDS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY... THE DUMP STRETCHES OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE FAR BANK OF THE WEST RIVER. I’M TOLD IT ENDS SOMEWHERE BEFORE THE FARMLANDS. IT SMELLS OF ROT AND RUST-- IT’S A BREEDING GROUND FOR INSECTS AND RODENTS. I CUT THE ENGINE AND LISTEN TO ONE OF THE RODENTS. I LISTEN FOR AS LONG AS I CAN STOMACH IT... ...THEN I LET THEM KNOW I’M HERE. THE BATMOBILE-- THAT’S WHAT YOU CALLED IT, DICK. KIND OF NAME A KID WOULD COME UP WITH... THEY DON’T EVEN WAIT FOR THE ORDER. YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS... ...NO RESPECT FOR HISTORY. I MODIFIED HER DURING SOME NASTY RIOTS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. THE ONLY THING I KNOW OF THAT CAN CUT THROUGH HER HIDE ISN’T FROM THIS PLANET. THE MUTANTS USE HAND GRENADES. THEY USE ROCKET LAUNCHERS. SOMETHING BOUNCES OFF THE HULL THAT MUST HAVE COME FROM A BAZOOKA. THEY DO EACH OTHER A LOT OF DAMAGE. RUBBER BULLETS. HONEST.THE LAST SHOTS HAVE STOPPED ECHOING... BUT THE MOANS AND CRIES WILL CONTINUE LONG INTO THE NIGHT... I FEEL THE EMPTY SEAT BESIDE ME AND ONCE AGAIN I THINK OF YOU, DICK... I LOOK AT THE ONE CREATURE WHO ISN’T WOUNDED OR HIDING... ...WE NEVER FACED ANYTHING LIKE THIS... WE ONLY FOUGHT HUMANS... ...BUT THERE HE IS, DICK-- THE MUTANT LEADER... ....A KIND OF EVIL WE NEVER DREAMED OF... ...THERE HE IS--SQUARE IN MY SIGHTS. – JUST PRESS THE TRIGGER AND BLAST HIM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THOUGH THAT MEANS CROSSING A LINE I DREW FOR MYSELF THIRTY YEARS AGO... ...I CAN’T THINK OF A SINGLE REASON TO LET
 HIM LIVE. EXCEPT... ...EXCEPT HE’S GOT EXACTLY THE KIND OF BODY I WISH HE DIDN’T HAVE... ...POWERFUL, WITHOUT ENOUGH BULK TO SLOW HIM DOWN... ...EVERY MUSCLE A STEEL SPRING-- READY TO LASH OUT-- --AND HE’S YOUNG... ...IN HIS PHYSICAL PRIME... ...AND I HONESTLY DON’T KNOW IF I COULD BEAT HIM. CAN’T HAVE A BACK DOOR, ALFRED. MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO USE IT. I MAKE HIM EAT SOME GARBAGE-- --THEN I HELP HIM SWALLOW IT. A BEAUTY TO HIS SOLAR PLEXIS—I WORRY HE MIGHT DROP TOO SOON-- ---THEN HIS CLAWS DIG INTO MY BACK-- --HIS FILED TEETH LIKE RAZORS IN MY TRAPEZIUS—HE’S RIGHT—HE HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD-- -- HE SHOWS ME WHAT A FAST KICK IS-- --SOMETHING EXPLODES IN MY MIDSECTION-- --SUNLIGHT BEHIND MY EYES AS THE PAIN RISES-- -- A MOVEMENT OF BLACKNESS—TOO SOON FOR THAT-- --TOO SOON—WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME-- --RIBS INTACT-- --NO INTERNAL BLEEDING-- --LET IT LOOK WORSE THAN IT IS-- --LET HIM GET CLOSE-- --NOT YET-- --NOT YET-- --GIVE HIM-- EVERYTHING I’VE GOT-- --HIS NECK-- HOLDS-- --HIS NOSE-- SHATTERS-- --BONE BITES INTO MY KNUCKLES-- --THE IDIOT-- --STARTS LAUGHING-- --INSANE—LET ME TAG HIM-- JUST TO SHOW-- -- HE CAN TAKE IT-- --OKAY--OKAY-- --SHOW ME -- SHOW ME EXACTLY-- --HOW MUCH-- --IT TAKES TO BREAK YOU-- --LEAST I CAN DO-- IS HURT HIM UP-- --ONE TO THE NECK-- SHOULD TEACH HIM BRAND-NEW KINDS OF PAIN-- -- WHERE -- WHERE’D HE GO-- --NO--DON’T GO INTO SHOCK... ...DON’T... ...COLD...GETTING COLD... ...COLD OLD COLD... ...NO...NO... ...DON’T GO INTO SHOCK... ...DICK... ...WHERE ARE YOU... DICK... YOU WERE ALWAYS... ...MY LITTLE MONKEY WRENCH... ...DICK... ...GOT YOURSELF IN DEEP AGAIN DICK... ...ALWAYS...IN OVER YOUR HEAD... ...REMEMBER TWO-FACE, DICK...?... ...ROBIN... THE BOY HOSTAGE... THAT’S WHAT TWO-FACED CALLED YOU... ...HEH...YOU HATED THAT... LUCKY...YOU’RE LUCKY I’M ALWAYS HERE... ...TO BAIL YOU OUT... ...DICK... STRETCHERS ON A GYROSCOPE... STAYS LEVEL... NO MATTER WHAT... I...KNOW WHAT SHE DID, ALFRED. WHERE... DID YOU LEARN TO SET AN ARM MAKE A SPLINT...? WHAT’S...YOUR NAME... MINE’S BRUCE... NO...HOSPITAL, ALFRED... ...THE CAVE... THE CAVE... ...AND ROBIN...COMES WITH US...THE CAVE... I LEAVE THEM BEHIND ME... I LEAVE... IT ALL BEHIND ME... I GO... ...TO THE DARK PLACE... ...WHERE I FIRST MET YOU... ...BEFORE MY PARENTS DIED... ...BEFORE I LEARNED WHAT I AM. I’M DYING... BUT I CAN’T DIE... I’M NOT FINISHED YET. ...AND YOU’RE NOT FINISHED WITH ME. THEN... ...SOMETHING SHUFFLES, OUT OF SIGHT... ...SOMETHING SUCLS THE STALE AIR... ...AND HISSES.GLIDING WITH ANCIENT GRACE... EYES GLEAMING UNTOUCHED BY LOVE OR JOY OR SORROW... BREATH HOT WITH THE TASTE OF FALLEN FOES... THE STENCH OF DEAD THINGS, DAMNED THINGS... SURELY THE FIERCEST SURVIVOR... THE PUREST WARRIOR... GLARING, HATING... ...CLAIMING ME AS
 YOUR OWN. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, ALFRED? CARRIE. SHE’S PERFECT. SHE’S YOUNG. SHE’S SMART. SHE’S BRAVE. WITH HER, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO END THIS MUTANT NONSENSE ONCE AND FOR ALL. YOU SEE, IT ALL GETS DOWN TO THEIR LEADER. THEY WORSHIP HIM... SHE’S MORE THAN THAT. I WILL NEVER FORGET JASON. HE WAS A GOOD SOLDIER. HE HONORED ME. BUT THE WAR GOES ON. YOUR TRAINING BEGINS TOMORROW. IT WILL BE WEEKS BEFORE YOU’RE READY FOR DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY. BECAUSE I WANT THEM THERE, JIM. NO, JIM. THEY CAN’T BE ARRESTED. YOU COULD NEVER HOLD THEM ALL. THEY HAVE TO BE DEFEATED. HUMILIATED. IT’S THE ONLY WAY, JIM. I’M COUNTING ON YOUR HELP. ONE LAST TIME, OLD FRIEND. GOOD BOY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AN OPEN DOOR. NOW, LET’S TRY A VENT IT’S YOUR WAY OUT. GOOD BOY. FORGOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE DROP. YOU’LL BE COMING ACROSS A HOLE SOON-- JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOU. THERE. JUST CLIMB INTO THE PIPE. REMEMBER-- RATS CARRY DISEASES. DON’T EAT ANY. CAN YOU SMELL THE RIVER YET? SEE THE END OF THE PIPE. THE ONLY THING BETWEEN YOU--AND IT-- --IS ME. OKAY, BOY. SHOW ME. HE’S FAST-- FASTER THAN I AM. AND STRONGER-- --AND SEEMINGLY IMPERVIOUS TO PAIN. BUT THEY DO COME SMARTER. --AND NOBODY’S VERY FAST WHEN HE’S THIGH-DEEP IN MUD. I WAIT FOR HIM TO TRY A KICK-- --GIVE HIM JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF CUT ABOVE THE EYES. THE KIND THAT BLEEDS. MY MISTAKE WAS TO TRY TO MATCH HIS SAVAGERY. TO FIGHT LIKE A YOUNG MAN. RIGHT ON SCHEDULE THE BLOOD HITS HIS EYES. I GRAB A CLUMP OF MUD. HE CHARGES, BLIND-- -- A QUICK ONE TO THE NEVER CLUSTER IN HIS DELTOID. IT DOESN’T HURT HIM-- -- BUT NO FORCE ON EARTH COULD HELP HIM MOVE HIS LEFT ARM NOW. HIS RIGHT-- --IT’S FAST-- --TOO FAST-- BLACKNESS-- COMES IN FROM THE EDGES-- I GET SICK OF THE ARM -- AND KILL IT BELOW THE ELBOW. HE SPINS--AT THE PERFECT MOMENT-- --GOES FOR MY THROAT-- --HAVE TO-- TAKE US DOWN-- YOU DON’T GET IT, BOY... THIS ISN’T A MUDHOLE... ...IT’S AN OPERATING TABLE. AND I’M THE SURGEON. SOMETHING TELLS ME TO STOP WITH THE LEG. I DON’T LISTEN TO IT. THE WIND RISES, TEARING DEAD LEAVES FREE. FROGS CROAK LIKE A CARTOON CAR ALARM. CRICKETS PICK UP THE CHORUS. A WOLF HOWLS. I KNOW HOW HE FEELS. I REPEAT DO NOT LET BRUNO SEE YOU. THIS IS AN ORDER. NEVER MEANT-- TO GIVE HER TIME-- --TO COOK THAT THING-- --THIS--WOULD BE A STUPID DEATH... LUCKY-- --LUCKY OLD MAN... SOFTENING UP--SHE’LL START TALKING SOON-- --WHAT’S THAT SOUND-- --THE FLOOR-- --IT’S SHAKING-- NO-- NO-- --NOT HIM-- --NOT NOW-- THE ROOM GOES HOT-- METAL EXPLODES-- SOMETHING HURLS ITSELF INTO THE SKY, SOMETHING LEAPS A TALL BUILDING WITH A SINGLE BOUND. MY ORDERS WERE SPECIFIC--WATCH IT-- --STILL YOU MADE YOURSELF VISIBLE TO BRUNO. I WILL
 NOT TOLERATE INSUBORDINATION-- --CAREFUL-- IF YOU DISOBEY, EVER AGAIN-- --YOU’RE FIRED. TO THE ONLY SOLID LEAD I’VE GOT LEFT, ROBIN. A MAN NAMED ABNER. PATIENCE ROBIN, IT’LL KEEP YOU ALIVE. ABNER ISN’T HOME. ROBIN! NO! I SAID NO! I’LL SEND ROBIN HOME. I’LL HELP THE EMERGENCY TEAMS AS BEST I CAN. I’LL COUNT THE DEAD, ONE BY ONE. I’LL ADD THEM TO THE LIST, JOKER. THE LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE I’VE MURDERED-- --BY LETTING YOU LIVE. NO, I WILL NOT TEACH YOU THE PROGRAM. TOUCH THOSE CONTROLS-- --AND YOU’RE FIRED. TOO SOON, THE PAINS START--ACROSS MY TRICEPS AND CHEST-- I KEEP FORGETTING HOW MUCH HARDER EVERYTHING HAS BECOME... ...HOW FAR I’M PUSHING IT... TWO DOZEN GUNS ARE COCKED-- -- I WAS WRONG -- --THESE CHILDREN--DON’T KNOW ME-- FIGHTING COPS. IT’S BEEN A WHILE... ...IT’S BEEN TWENTY YEARS... ...EVEN MY THERMITE IS OLD... LUCKY--LUCKY--CAN’T BELIEVE IT-- --I’M ALREADY BREATHING HARD-- WHEEZING NOW--CHEST LIKE A BLAST FURNACE-- --SO MANY OF THEM... ...SO MANY...AND THEY’RE ALL... ...SO YOUNG... --LUCKY OLD MAN... BOOSTERS. BOOSTERS. WHAT... FULL SPEED TO THE CAVE. WE’LL SWITCH TO THE CYCLE. YOU’RE NOT FIRED. IT’S A .45 CALIBER BULLET. HOLLOW POINT. IT EXPLODES IN HIS CHEST. I FEEL THE SHOCK THROUGH HIS FINGERS. FOR THE HUNDRED THOUSANDTH TIME-- --MY FATHER DIES... ...WHERE’D YOU LEARN ABOUT COMPUTERS, ROBIN? QUIET--I’M PICKING SOMETHING UP-- --A TELEVISION TRANSMISSION-- HOW MUCH LONGER... HAVE I GOT... I’M FINE, ROBIN. JUST PICK THAT LOCK LIKE I TAUGHT YOU. SELINA... HOW MANY MORE--WILL I TAKE?... COTTON CANDY. THE COUNTY FAIR. THOUSANDS. ...HOW MANY MORE--UNTIL I FINALLY DO IT? POLICE ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF US, ROBIN. BRING THE WING IN CLOSE. SHE GOT HERE FASTER THAN I PLANNED... ...REMINDS ME OF JIM-- IN THE OLD DAYS......YOU TRIED TO WARN ME, JIM... ...SO MANY TIMES... ...YOU TOLD ME THAT I BREAK TOO MANY OF THE IMPORTANT RULES... ...THAT I’VE MADE TOO MANY OF THE WRONG ENEMIES... ...THAT, FOR ALL MY TRICKS... I’VE BEEN GETTING BY ON LUCK... ...IT’S ALL A GAME OF ODDS, YOU SAID... ...ALL IT WILL TAKE... IS ONE BULLET. COLD WAVES LAP GOTHAM HARBOR... ...LIKE THEY HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD... ...SHE DOESN’T MAKE A SOUND... GOOD SOLDIER. GOOD SOLDIER. THE GOVERNOR’S LIFE IS IN DANGER. I HAVEN’T TIME TO SAVE HIM. IT’S UP TO YOU. SOMEWHERE A WOMAN CALLS OUT FOR HER SON... SOMEWHERE A CALLIOPE PLAYS THE SAME TUNE, AGAIN AND AGAIN... ...A TINY HAND TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON MY ARM... ...A GIRL OF THIRTEEN BREATHES IN SHARPLY, SUDDENLY, HER INNOCENCE LOST... ...IT ENDS TONIGHT, JOKER. IT’S LOADED ROBIN-- --LET IT GET CLOSE-- --WAIT FOR MY ORDER-- CAN YOU SEE IT, JOKER? FEELS TO ME...LIKE IT’S WRITTEN ALL OVER MY FACE. I’VE LAIN
 AWAKE NIGHTS... PLANNING IT...PICTURING IT...ENDLESS NIGHTS... ...CONSIDERING EVERY POSSIBLE METHOD... TREASURING EACH IMAGINARY MOMENT... FROM THE BEGINNING, I KNEW... ...THAT THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU... ...THAT I CAN’T FIX... ...WITH MY HANDS... A SMOKE BOMB. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. NO, JOKER. YOU’RE PLAYING THE WRONG GAME, THE OLD GAME. TONIGHT YOU’RE TAKING NO HOSTAGES. TONIGHT I’M TAKING NO PRISONERS. JOKER... PUT THE BOY DOWN... YOU’VE STILL GOT... ...ONE EYE LEFT... TOO SLOW-- HE HEARS THE GLASS-- HE GETS-- --A GOOD ONE IN-- --GLANCED OFF A RIB-- --TOOK SOME MEAT WITH IT-- HE’S FAST-- AS EVER-- --WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ME-- --DIZZY-- --NOT DIZZY--NOT ALREADY-- --I’M TAKING TOO LONG-- GIVING HIM-- --TOO MANY CHANCES----THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME-- --INSTEAD OF A MIRROR-- --THAT’S RIGHT, JOKER-- --WASTE THOSE BULLETS-- WATCH... ...WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE, SON...I’M TOO LATE...FOR THE ONE ON THE BOARDWALK... TOO LATE... ...FOR THE TWO AT THE TUNNEL... TOO LATE... TOO OLD... ...THE LAST TWO, JOKER... ...MY VOW... ...IT’S BAD... ...DON’T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN STAY AWAKE... ...HAVE TO...FINISH HIM QUICKLY... COLD... ...WATER’S COLD... NO... ...IT ISN’T... ...THE WATER... A GUN... IS A COWARD’S WEAPON. A LIAR’S WEAPON. WE KILL...TOO OFTEN...BECAUSE WE’VE MADE IT EASY... TOO EASY... ...SPARING OURSELVES...

STRAIGHT OUT OF HELL THERE’S THIS SHRIEK... ...IT TURNS INTO A GROWL--FLAPPING OF WINGS--BIG WINGS-- --SOMETHING WET HAPPENS TO THE CREEP-- --A SIDE OF BEEF SLAMS INTO THE LAMPPOST-- --A SWITCHBLADE SNAPS OPEN-- BONES START POPPING INSIDE THE CREEP-- HE’S SCREAMING AND BEGGING-- --WHAT GRABBED HIM IS LAUGHING AND SO AM I... CLARK, YOU IDIOT. YOU LET THEM DO IT. I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WOULD. MAYBE DURING A BREAK BETWEEN POLICE ACTIONS, ONE OF YOUR MILITARY FRIENDS TOLD YOU WHAT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE IS. AND MAYBE YOU LISTENED, CLAR. ALL YOU NEED TO GENERATE THE PULSE IS THE ORGANIZED DETONATION OF A FEW DOZEN NUCLEAR WARHEADS. THAT, OR A SPECIAL KIND OF NUKE THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DEVELOP... ...YES, CLARK. BOTH SIDES. THE AMERICAN NAME FOR IT IS COLDBRINGER. IT’S DESIGNED TO CAUSE MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT-- ALL THE WHILE SPARING THE INDUSTRIAL SITES YOUR FRIENDS REGARD SO HIGHLY. SINCE MY OWN ATOMS AREN’T BOUNCING AROUND THE STRATOSPHERE-- --SINCE GOTHAM CITY SQUATS LIKE A GREAT BLACK GRAVEYARD-- --SINCE WAYNE MANOR’S EMERGENCY GENERATOR HASN’T KICKED IN-- AND ROBIN’S WATCH HAS STOPPED-- --I’LL ASSUME RUSSIA HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE ARMS RACE. I KEEP TRACK OF THESE THINGS, CLARK. ONE OF US HAS TO. TO THE STABLES, ROBIN. THE DUMP. IT’S A BREEDING GROUND FOR INSECTS AND RODENTS. SOME RODENTS FLY. THIS LOUD, CLUMSY, STUPID THING-- THIS IS THE WEAPON OF THE ENEMY. WE DO NOT NEED IT. WE WILL NOT USE IT. OUR WEAPONS ARE QUIET--PRECISE. IN TIME, I WILL TEACH THEM TO YOU. TONIGHT, YOU WILL RELY ON YOUR FISTS-- AND YOUR BRAINS. TONIGHT, WE ARE THE LAW. TONIGHT, I AM THE LAW. LET’S RIDE. BOYS, GIRLS... ...I’M HERE TO APPEAL TO YOUR COMMUNITY SPIRIT. I’M SURE YOU’RE ALL EAGER TO HELP. I’M SURPRISED HE TOOK THE CHANCE OF COMING TO AMERICA-- WITH CLARK IN THE COUNTRY-- -- BUT OLIVER HAS ALWAYS LIVED BY HIS IMPULSES. THIS PARTICULAR IMPULSE I CAN UNDERSTAND... OLIVER--WHAT DO YOU WANT? HE USED TO FIGHT CRIME. RIGHT THERE-- IN THAT SADDLE-- IS ALL THE REASON I NEED... ...IT’S ALMOST FRIGHTENING HOW QUICKLY SHE’S LEARNING TO RIDE... SHE HAS DECADES-- DECADES, LEFT TO HER... ...THEN--A BLAST OF HEAT-- --FROM THE SKY-- --AND IT BEGINS... CRIME ALLEY. OLIVER-- MAYBE OLVER WAS RIGHT... ALL ALONG... ...CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS... THAT’S ENOUGH, ALFRED. ...WHEN YOU CAME FOR ME... IN THE CAVE... I WAS JUST SIX YEARS OLD... ...YOU WERE ANCIENT...
 NOTHING COULD KILL YOU... ...BUT THE WAR... ...IT DID NOT BEGIN THEN... NO..IT WAS...TWO YEARS LATER...WHEN HER NECKLACE AUGHT ON HIS WRIST... ...WHEN HE SHOVED HIS PISTOL TO HER JAW AND PULLED THE TRIGGER... ...AND EVERYTHING MY MOTHER WAS STRUCK THE PAVEMENT AS A BLOODY WAD... THAT NIGHT... BEGAN THIRTY YEARS OF HUNTING THIEVES AND MURDERERS. ...IS THAT WHAT YOU INTENDED?... SOMEWHERE IN THE ENDLESS NIGHT... LIKE A BELLOW FROM A WOUNDED BEAR... ...THE ANSWER COMES... THE TIMING...MUST BE EXACT... ...IN ONE HOUR... AT MIDNIGHT... ...A GRAND DEATH... THIS ONE YOU WON’T BELIEVE, CLARK. MY BEST TRICK... THEY LEAVE A HOLE IN THE CORDON BIG ENOUGH TO DRIVE A TANK THROUGH. THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT I DO. TWENTY MINUTES LEFT. I KNOW YOU WON’T BE LATE, CLARK. YOU HATE TO STAY UP LATE. FIGURE I WILL. THE WIND PICKS UP... THAT’S RIGHT, CLARK... SCAN THE ARE... ...BATHE IT WITH X-RAYS... ...ACTIVATE THOSE SIX HUNTER MISSILES I WORKED SO HARD ON. THIS IS A POWERS TEST... ...I WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH OF YOU SURVIVED THAT NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. HE’S HAVE TO BE AT FULL SPEED TO DODGE THEM... HE ISN’T I WATCH THEM KICK HIM AROUND FOR A MINUTE. I’VE HAD WORSE TIMES. HE HITS THE GROUND ON SCHEDULE. ONE BLOCK FROM ME. BREATHING A LITTLE FAST-- IT’S ROBIN’S TURN-- THE CHARGE COULD SINK A BATTLESHIP. I THINK HE FEELS IT. MORE WIND. NOW HE’S TALKING--TRYING TO REASON WITH ME. I CAN’T HEAR HIM, OF COURSE... ...NO, MY EARS ARE PROTECTED--SO ALL I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS MY TEETH-- --RATTLING FROM MY JAW-- OR SHATTERING, LIKE EVERY WINDOW ON THE BLOCK-- --WHEN I HIT HIM WITH THE SONIC. A NOSEBLEED-- SO SOON, CLARK-- DON’T DROP NOW-- THE NIGHT IS YOUNG-- AND I HAVE--SO MUCH PLANNED-- --AND IT HAS TO END HERE--ON THIS FILTHY PATCH OF STREET-- --WHERE MY PARENTS DIED... ...WHERE I CAN USE THE CITY’S POWER-- --EVERY WATT OF IT-- --TO FRY YOUR BRAIN-- --STILL TALKING--KEEP TALKING, CLARK... ...YOU’VE ALWAYS KNOWN JUST WHAT TO SAY. “YES”-- YOU ALWAYS SAY YES--TO ANYONE WITH A BADGE--OR A FLAG-- --NO GOOD-- --THE FEEDBACK-- I’M NOT GETTING A HUNDREDTH OF WHAT YOU ARE-- --BUT IT’S GETTING BAD-- AHEAD OF SCHEDULE-- --WHAT DIDN’T HIT YOU--AND ME--FED THIS SUIT, CLARK-- --IT’S WAY PAST TIME YOU LEARNED--WHAT IT MEANS-- --TO BE A MAN-- YOU SOLD US OUT, CLARK. YOU GAVE THEM--THE POWER--THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OURS. JUST LIKE YOUR PARENTS TAUGHT YOU TO. MY PARENTS... TAUGHT ME A DIFFERENT LESSON... --LYING ON THIS STREET--SHAKING IN DEEP SHOCK-- --DYING FOR NO REASON AT ALL-- --THEY SHOWED ME THAT THE WORLD ONLY MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU FORCE IT TO... WRIST...CRUSHED...RIBS MOVING...WITH A LIFE OF THEIR OWN... ...AND CLARK...JUST BROKE...A SWEAT... NOW...IF OLIVER DOESN’T SCREW
UP... ...OH NO... --OLIVER...YOU CLOWN... ...YOU PROMISED YOU’D KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THE SOLDIERS... ...CLARK... ...IF CLARK FIGURES OUT WHY YOU’RE HERE... ...A LITTLE ACID.. TO DISTRACT HIM... OLIVER-- ...GET YOURSELF KILLED... ON YOUR OWN TIME... ..I’VE ONLY GOT ONE MINUTE LEFT. ...AND I’M RUNNING OUT OF TRICKS... OLIVER-- --I’VE FINALLY GOTTEN HIM ANGRY-- --IT’S NOW OR NEVER-- YOU’RE BEGINNING TO GET THE IDEA, CLARK... ..THIS...IS THE END... ...FOR BOTH OF US... WE COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD.. ...NOW...LOOK AT US... I’VE BECOME A POLITICAL LIABILITY... ...AND YOU... ...YOU’RE A JOKE... ..I WANT YOU... TO REMEMBER, CLARK... ...IN ALL THE YEARS TO COME... ...IN YOUR MOST PRIVATE MOMENTS... I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER...MY HAND... AT YOUR THROAT... ...I WANT... YOU TO REMEMBER... ...THE ONE MAN WHO BEAT YOU... MY TIMING WASN’T QUITE PRECISE ENOUGH. CLARK HEARD. THAT WAS THE FIRST THING ROBIN TOLD ME-- --WHEN SHE DUG ME UP. NOT THAT IT MATTERED. HE’D HAVE GUESSED SOONER OR LATER. HE KNOWS HOW GOOD I AM WITH CHEMICALS. I WAS COUNTING ON WHAT OLIVER SAID. AND WITH A WINK-- --CLARK PROVED OLIVER RIGHT. HE’LL LEAVE ME ALONE, NOW, IN RETURN, I’LL STAY QUIET. SO WILL ROBIN-- AND THE REST... CAREFUL WITH THAT-- GOOD, NOW GATHER ROUND. WE HAVEN’T GOT ALL NIGHT, BOY. THAT’S NOT TRUE... ...WE HAVE YEARS-- AS MANY AS WE NEED... FIRST WE GET A STEADY SUPPLY OF WATER. THERE’S A SPRING RIGHT BENEATH-- --ROBIN! SIT UP STRAIGHT. YEARS-- TO TRAIN AND STUDY AND PLAN... ..HERE, IN THE ENDLESS CAVE, FAR PAST THE BURNT REMAINS OF A CRIMEFIGHTER WHOSE TIME HAS PASSED... IT BEGINS HERE-- AN ARMY--TO BRING SENSE TO A WORLD PLAGUED BY WORSE THAN THIEVES AND MURDERERS... THIS WILL BE A GOOD LIFE... ...GOOD ENOUGH.
