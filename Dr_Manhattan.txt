GOOD EVENING, RORSCHACH. YES. SINCE HE AND I ARE THE ONLY TWO EXTRANORMAL OPERATIVES CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT, I WAS INFORMED ON SATURDAY MORNING. I UNDERSTAND THE C.I.A. SUSPECTS THE LIBYANS WERE RESPONSIBLE. A LIVE BODY AND A DEAD BODY CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF PARTICLES. STRUCTURALLY, THERE’S NO DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE. LIFE AND DEATH ARE UNQUANTIFIABLE ABSTRACTS. WHY SHOULD I BE CONCERNED? YOU SEEM TO BE UPSETTING LAURIE. IT THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO.I SAID I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO. HE’S GONE. ARE YOU STILL UPSET? YES, LAURIE? OF COURSE NOT. I’D JOIN YOU, BUT I THINK I’M CLOSE TO LOCATING A GLUINO, WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY VALIDATE SUPERSYMMETRICAL THEORY IF WE COULD INCLUDE IT IN THE BESTIARY. I SUPPOSE V.V.N. NIGHT MUST MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM. YOU SOUND BITTER. YOU’RE A STRANGE MAN, BLAKE. YOU HAVE STRANGE ATTITUDES TO LIFE AND WAR. THE CHARRED VILLAGES, THE BOYS WITH NECKLACES OF HUMAN EARS... THESE ARE PART OF THE JOKE? YOU’RE ANXIOUS TO LEAVE? BLAKE? BLAKE DON’T... DO IT. BLAKE, SHE WAS PREGNANT. YOU GUNNED HER DOWN. NO. WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. LAURIE? DON’T BE UPSET. I THOUGHT YOU’D ENJOY IT. I DO TRY TO PLEASE YOU. I’M SORRY. I DON’T KNOW WHAT STIMULATES YOU ANYMORE. WELL, IF YOU’RE SURE. PERHAPS I’LL GET READY FOR MY INTERVIEW. LAURIE? \LAURIE? ARE YOU OKAY? LAURIE, TRY TO UNDERSTAND. LAURIE, MY WORK’S AT AN IMPORTANT STAGE! IT SEEMED UNNECESSARY TO... LAURIE, CAN’T WE TALK? IF YOU THINK THERE’S A PROBLEM WITH MY ATTITUDE, I’M PREPARED TO DISCUSS IT. LAURIE? IS THIS DARK ENOUGH?
“UP” IS A RELATIVE CONCEPT. IT HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN CURRENTLY REQUIRING MY ATTENTIONS. I REMEMBER WALLY AS A GOOD FRIEND. I ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL. MOLOCH? NO... NO, I DIDN’T KNOW THAT. I’D RATHER NOT... JANEY...? BUT... I WASN’T TOLD... ARE... ARE YOU SUGGESTING...?
NO. PLEASE... IF YOU’LL LET ME THROUGH... PLEASE... IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME ALONE... I SAID LEAVE ME ALONE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SAFETY REGULATIONS. I SEE. IT SEEMS I’M INCAPABLE OF COHABITING SAFELY EITHER EMOTIONALLY OR PHYSICALLY. PERHAPS YOU’D BEST TELL ME MS. JUSPECZYK AND YOUR SUPERIORS THAT I’M LEAVING.
YES. FOR ARIZONA FIRST, I THINK, AND THEN MARS. THE PHOTOGRAPH IS IN MY HAND. IT IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN AND A WOMAN. THEY ARE AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK, IN 1959. IN TWELVE SECONDS TIME, I DROP THE
 PHOTOGRAPH TO THE SAND AT MY FEET, WALKING AWAY. IT’S ALREADY LYING THERE, TWELVE SECONDS INTO THE FUTURE. TEN SECONDS NOW. THE PHOTOGRAPH IS IN MY HAND. I FOUND IT IN A DERELICT BAR AT THE GILA FLATS TEST BASE, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO. IT’S STILL THERE, TWENTY-SEVEN HOURS INTO THE PAST, IN ITS FRAME, IN THE DARKENED BAR. I’M STILL THERE, LOOKING AT IT. THE PHOTOGRAPH IS IN MY HAND. THE WOMAN TAKES A PIECE OF POPCORN BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER. THE FERRIS WHEEL PAUSES. SEVEN SECONDS NOW. IT’S OCTOBER, 1985. I’M ON MARS. IT’S JULY 1959. I’M IN NEW JERSEY, AT THE PALISADES AMUSEMENT PARK. FOUR SECONDS. THREE. I’M TIRED OF LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH NOW. I OPEN MY FINGERS. IT FALLS TO THE SAND AT MY FEET. I AM GOING TO LOOK AT THE STARS. THEY ARE SO FAR AWAY, AND THEIR LIGHT TAKES SO LONG TO REACH US... ALL WE EVER SEE OF STARS ARE THEIR OLD PHOTOGRAPHS. I AM TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION KILOMETERS FROM THE SUN. ITS LIGHT IS ALREADY TEN MINUTES OLD. IT WILL NOT REACH PLUTO FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS. TWO HOURS INTO MY FUTURE, I OBSERVE METEORITES FROM A GLASS BALCONY, THINKING ABOUT MY FATHER. TWELVE SECONDS INTO MY PAST, I OPEN MY FINGERS. THE PHOTOGRAPH IS FALLING. I AM WATCHING THE STARS. HALLEY’S COMET TUMBLES THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM ON ITS GREAT SEVENTY-SIX-YEAR ELLIPSE. MY FATHER ADMIRED THE SKY FOR ITS PRECISION. HE REPAIRED WATCHES. IT’S 1945. I SIT IN A BROOKLYN KITCHEN, FASCINATED BY AN ARRANGEMENT OF COGS ON BLACK VELVET. I AM SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. IT IS 1985. I AM ON MARS. I AM FIFTY-SIX YEARS OLD.
THE PHOTOGRAPH LIES AT MY FEET, FALLS FROM MY FINGERS, IS IN MY HAND. I AM WATCHING THE STARS, ADMIRING THEIR COMPLEX TRAJECTORIES, THROUGH SPACE, THROUGH TIME. I AM TRYING TO GIVE A NAME TO THE FORCE THAT SET THEM IN MOTION. IT IS AUGUST 7T  H , 1945. THE BROOKLYN MORNING IS HUMID AND THE FIRE ESCAPE DOOR HAS BEEN LEFT OPEN. IN HERE. I’M PRACTICING ON YOUR OLD POCKET WATCH, BEFORE IT’S TIME FOR SCHOOL. NEWS? FATHER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY! GIVE ME THAT BACK! ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE, THE METEORITES HAIL DOWN THROUGH THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE OF MARS... IT IS 1948, AND I AM ARRIVING AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. IT IS 1958 AND I AM GRADUATING WITH A PH.D IN ATOMIC PHYSICS. THE COGS ARE FALLING... IT’S MAY 12T  H , 1959: MY FIRST DAY AT GILA FLATS. PROFESSOR GLASS IS SHAKING MY HAND, ASKING WALLY WEAVER TO SHOW ME AROUND. THE SCENT OF HIS TURKISH CIGARETTE IS THICK IN THE CRAMPED OFFICE. I’M THIRTY YEARS OLD... NOT WHILE I WAS. HEARD HIM LECTURE ONCE, THOUGH. WELL, I GUESS HE’S JUST HUMAN, LIKE
 EVERYBODY ELSE. WHAT’S THIS PLACE? AND THIS? WALLY STEERS ME FROM THE ARIZONA SUNLIGHT INTO THE CROWDED BAR. THERE’S A SUDDEN SENSATION OF DÉJÀ VU: I’VE SEEN THIS PLACE BEFORE... ...EXCEPT THAT IT WAS DESERTED THEN, DERELICT, WITH STARLIGHT SHINING DOWN UPON ITS ROTTEN FLOORBOARDS, THROUGH THE COLLAPSED CEILING... THE ILLUSION VANISHES, ALMOST BEFORE IT HAS REGISTERED. IT’S MAY 12T  H , 1959. WALLY IS INTRODUCING ME TO SOMEONE... I AM? WELL, YOU KNOW... MY DAD SORT OF PUSHED ME INTO IT. THAT HAPPENS TO ME A LOT. OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO MAKE ALL MY MOVES FOR ME. SHE BUYS ME A BEER, THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN HAS EVER DONE THIS FOR ME. AS SHE PASSES ME THE COLD, PERSPIRING GLASS, OUR FINGERS TOUCH... IT’S 1963. WE’RE MAKING LOVE AFTER AN ARGUMENT, OUR TENDERNESS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO ITS VIOLENCE. IT’S 1966, AND SHE’S PACKING: TEARFUL, CARELESS WITH ANGER... IT’S JULY 1959. I’M RETURNING TO NEW JERSEY ON VACATION, VISITING OLD UNIVERSITY FRIENDS. JANEY SHARES THE TRIP FROM ARIZONA. HER MOTHER LIVES IN JERSEY. SHE CALLS HOME FROM THE STATION, BUT NOBODY ANSWERS. WE VISIT THE AMUSEMENT PARK, KILLING TIME UNTIL HER MOTHER RETURNS. BUT WE’RE NOT... HE GIVES US AN ADDRESS WHERE WE CAN PICK UP 75-CENT PRINTS, AND WE WALK OFF TOWARDS THE TILT-A-WHIRL, LAUGHING AT HIS MISTAKE. BY THE SHOOTING GALLERY, JANEY’S WATCHBAND SNAPS. BEFORE I CAN PICK IT UP, A FAT MAN STEPS UPON IT. I TELL HER I CAN FIX IT. HER MOTHER STILL ISN’T ANSWERING. WE DECIDE TO CALL AGAIN FROM MY HOTEL. WE BOTH KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. EVENTS MESH TOGETHER WITH SOFT PRECISION... WE REACH THE HOTEL. SHE CALLS AGAIN. HER MOTHER STILL ISN’T HOME. SHE ASKS IF I CAN REALLY FIX HER WATCH. WE SIT TOGETHER ON THE EDGE OF THE BED, EXAMINING THE DAMAGE. IT’S 1959. A PULSE FLUTTERS IN HER BELLY, BENEATH MY CHEEK. IT’S 1966. THE SUITCASE WON’T SHUT AND SHE’S CRYING. IT’S 1985. IN ONE HUNDRED MINUTES, THE METEORITE SHOWER BEGINS. IT’S AUGUST 1959. WE’VE BEEN BACK FROM JERSEY A MONTH. IN MY FUTURE, THE ACCIDENT IS WAITING FOR ME. YES! MATTER OF FACT, I DID! IT’S RIGHT... OH. NOTHING. I LEFT IT IN MY LAB COAT WHEN WE WERE RESETTING THE I.F. CHAMBER THIS MORNING. YOU WAIT RIGHT THERE. I CROSS THE SQUARE TO THE INTRINSIC FIELD CENTER. MY COAT’S INSIDE THE TEST CHAMBER. I CAN SEE IT THROUGH THE FOOT THICK WINDOW... THE ACCIDENT IS ALMOST UPON ME NOW.
THE OTHERS RETURN FROM LUNCH AND I ASK THEM TO LET ME OUT, LAUGHING AT MY OWN STUPIDITY. NOBODY ELSE LAUGHS. DR. GLASS IS TURNING WHITE. HE EXPLAINS THAT THE DOOR HAS LOCKED AUTOMATICALLY WHILE THE GENERATORS WARM UP FOR THIS AFTERNOON’S EXPERIMENT: REMOVING THE
 INTRINSIC FIELD FROM CONCRETE BLOCK FIFTEEN. I ASK HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER FOURTEEN... ... AND HE TELLS ME. JANEY? DON’T GO! I NEED... THE DOOR SLAMS BEHIND HER. I LOOK AT DR. GLASS BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. I CAN HEAR THE SHIELDS SLIDING BACK FORM THE PARTICLE CANNONS. THERE’S SOMETHING IN MY POCKET. I TAKE IT OUT TO EXAMINE... GOOD AS NEW. THE AIR GROWS TOO WARM, TOO QUICKLY. I WANT VERY MUCH FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TO HAND ME A GLASS OF VERY COLD BEER. ALL THE ATOMS IN THE TEST CHAMBER ARE SCREAMING AT ONCE. THE LIGHT... THE LIGHT IS TAKING ME TO PIECES. IT’S SEPTEMBER. A TOKEN FUNERAL SERVICE IS BEING HELD. THERE’S NOTHING TO BURY. IT’S OCTOBER. JANEY PLACES OUR JERSEY SNAPSHOT BEHIND GLASS IN THE BESTIARY. IT’S THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPH OF ME ANYONE HAS. IT’S NOVEMBER. IT’S NOVEMBER 10T  H NOW. THERE IS A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WALKING THROUGH THE KITCHEN... NOVEMBER 14T  H : A PARTIALLY MUSCLED SKELETON STANDS BY THE PERIMETER FENCE AND SCREAMS FOR THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE VANISHING. REALLY, IT’S JUST A QUESTION OF REASSEMBLING THE COMPONENTS IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE... IT’S NOVEMBER 22N  D . THEIR BLEACHED FACES STARE UP AT ME, PALE AND INSUBSTANTIAL IN THE SUDDEN FLARE OF ULTRAVIOLET. SUNBURN IN NOVEMBER. IT’S OCTOBER, 1985. I’M BASKING IN THE TWO-MILLION-YEAR-OLD LIGHT OF ANDROMEDA. I CAN SEE THE SUPERNOVA THAT ERNST HARTWIG DISCOVERED IN 1885, A CENTURY AGO. IT SCINTILLATES, A WINK INTENDED FOR THE TRILOBITES, ALL LONG DEAD. SUPERNOVAS ARE WHERE GOLD FORMS; THE ONLY PLACE. ALL GOLD COMES FROM SUPERNOVAS. IT’S CHRISTMAS 1959.
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. IT’S ATOMIC STRUCTURE IS A PERFECT GRID, LIKE A CHECKER-BOARD. IT’S... JANEY? WHAT’S UP? ARE YOU COLD? I CAN RAISE THE TEMPERATURE. OF ME? I DON’T THINK THERE IS A GOD, JANEY. IF THERE IS, I’M NOT HIM. I’M STILL THE SAME PERSON. NOTHING’S CHANGED. I STILL WANT YOU... I’LL ALWAYS WANT YOU. AS I LIE I HEAR HER SHOUTING AT ME IN 1963; SOBBING IN 1966. MY FINGERS OPEN. THE PHOTOGRAPH IS FALLING... IT’S FEBRUARY, 1960, AND EVERYTHING IS FROZEN. I AM STARTING TO ACCEPT THAT I SHALL NEVER FEEL COLD OR WARM AGAIN. I DON’T LIKE IT... ESPECIALLY THIS HELMET. WHAT’S THIS SYMBOL STAND FOR? IT’S MEANINGLESS. A HYDROGEN ATOM WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. I DON’T THINK I SHALL BE WEARING THIS. THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT I NEED. YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I NEED. IF I’M TO HAVE A SYMBOL, IT SHALL BE ONE I RESPECT. THERE. DOCTOR WHAT? THEY EXPLAIN THAT THE NAME HAS BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE OMINOUS ASSOCIATIONS IT WILL RAISE IN AMERICA’S ENEMIES. THEY’RE SHAPING ME INTO SOMETHING GAUDY AND LETHAL. IT’S ALL GETTING OUT OF MY HANDS...
 MARCH, 1960... HAVE I? SOMETIMES I FEEL AS IF I’VE BEEN HERE ALL THE TIME. I’M THERE NOW, IN 1960, SAVING THOSE WORDS, WATCHING THAT T.V. SET... NOW IT’S JUNE, A CHARITY EVENT WITH SEVERAL COSTUMED ADVENTURERS ATTENDING... FRIENDLY MIDDLE-AGED MEN WHO LIKE DRESS UP. I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THEM. ONLY THE YOUNGEST, CALLED OZYMANDIAS, SEEMS INTERESTING... IT’S NOVEMBER. THE NEWSPAPERS CALL ME A CRIMEFIGHTER, SO THE PENTAGON SAYS I MUST FIGHT CRIME. IN MOLOCH’S UNDERGROUND VICE-DEN, THE SIGHS TURN TO SCREAMS OF TERROR. THE MORTALITY OF MY ACTIVITIES ESCAPES ME. IT’S SEPTEMBER, 1961. JOHN KENNEDY IS SHAKING MY HAND, ASKING WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE A SUPERHERO. I TELL HIM HE SHOULD KNOW AND HE NODS, LAUGHING... TWO YEARS LATER, IN DALLAS, HIS HEAD SNAPS FORWARD AND THEN BACK. TWO SHOTS... IN MAY, 1962, A MASKED MAN RETIRES TO OPEN AN AUTO BUSINESS. HIS REAL NAME IS HOLLIS MASON. WE ARE TALKING AFTER A CIVIC BANQUET IN HIS HONOR. DALLAS IS STILL EIGHTEEN MONTHS AWAY... THEN WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN. TO RETIRE NOW? IS IT YOUR AGE? WELL, THE NEW ELECTRIC CARS SHOULD BE EVEN SIMPLER. THAT’S RIGHT. THEY’D HAVE APPEARED BEFORE, BUT THERE WASN’T ENOUGH LITHIUM TO MASS-PRODUCE POLYACETYLENE BATTERIES. OF COURSE, I CAN SYNTHESIZE IT EASILY. ANYWAY, IT’S BEEN INTERESTING MEETING YOU AGAIN. I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR RETIREMENT. EIGHTEEN MONTHS AWAY, AN ELECTRIC LIMOUSINE IS PULLING ONTO DEALEY PLAZA... I CAN’T PREVENT THE FUTURE. TO ME, IT’S ALREADY HAPPENING. IN 1959, I COULD HEAR YOU SHOUTING, HERE. NOW, IN 1963. SOON WE MAKE LOVE... NO. WE MAKE LOVE RIGHT AFTER WALLY ARRIVES WITH THE EARRING I ORDERED FOR YOU... IT’S 1963. AN HOUR INTO THE FUTURE HER SWEAT COOLS AND DRIES IN THE NOVEMBER BEDROOM. IT’S 1964. I’M INFORMING THE PENTAGON THAT I’LL NO LONGER BE WEARING THE WHOLE OF MY COSTUME. IT’S 1966. I’M IN A ROOM OF PEOPLE WEARING DISGUISES.
A VERY YOUNG GIRL SITS TO MY RIGHT. SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SMILES.
IN 1985, MY HANDS ARE ENCIRCLING HER FACE. IN 1966, THE COSTUMED PEOPLE ARE ARGUING. JANEY IS TUGGING AT MY ARM... WHAT’S THE MATTER? SHE’S BEAUTIFUL. AFTER EACH LONG KISS, SHE PLANTS A SMALLER, GENTLER ONE UPON MY LIPS, LIKE A SIGNATURE. IN 1966, THE MASKS ARE STILL SQUABBLING... SOON, THE MEETING BREAKS UP. JANEY’S VOICE IS COLD, FURIOUS. OUTSIDE, JANEY ACCUSES ME OF “CHASING JAILBAIT.” SHE BURSTS INTO ANGRY TEARS ASKING IF IT’S BECAUSE SHE’S GETTING OLDER. IT’S TRUE. SHE’S AGING MORE NOTICEABLY EVERY DAY... ... WHILE I’M STANDING STILL.
 MAY, 1966. YES. MY NAME’S JON. IT’S 1959. JANEY IS HANDING ME THE GLASS. IT’S 1966, AND SHE’S PACKING: TEARFUL; CARELESS WITH ANGER... THE PHOTOGRAPH LIES IN THE SAND AT MY FEET. IN 1969, I’M RECEIVING NEWS OF MY FATHER’S DEATH. IN 1959, HE’S OPENING A TELEGRAM FROM THE MILITARY INFORMING HIM OF HIS SON’S ACCIDENTAL DISINTEGRATION. I NEVER CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE. GILA FLATS CLOSES DOWN IN 1970. ON LAURIE’S TWENTIETH BIRTHDAY, WE MOVE INTO OUR NEW WASHINGTON APARTMENT. I’VE REVEALED MY TRUE NAME TO THE PUBLIC. AFTER MY FATHER’S DEATH, THERE SEEMS LITTLE POINT IN CONCEALING IT. IN JANUARY 1971, PRESIDENT NIXON IS ASKING ME TO INTERVENE IN VIETNAM, WHILE TEN YEARS EARLIER, KENNEDY IS AVOIDING ANY MENTION OF CUBA. LATER IN NOVEMBER, I’M TOLD THAT WALLY WEAVER HAS DIED OF CANCER, AGED 34. IT’S MARCH. I’M IN SAIGON, BEING REINTRODUCED TO EDWARD BLAKE, THE COMEDIAN. HE WORKS MOSTLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT NOW. I SUPPOSE I DO, TOO. BLAKE IS INTERESTING. I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE SO DELIBERATELY AMORAL. HE SUITS THE CLIMATE HERE=THE MADNESS, THE POINTLESS BUTCHERY... AS I COME TO UNDERSTAND VIETNAM AND WHAT IT IMPLIES ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION, I ALSO REALIZE THAT FEW HUMANS WILL PERMIT THEMSELVES SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING. BLAKE’S DIFFERENT. HE UNDERSTANDS PERFECTLY... AND HE DOESN’T CARE. IT’S MAY. I HAVE BEEN HERE TWO MONTHS. THE VIETCONG ARE EXPECTED TO SURRENDER WITHIN THE WEEK. MANY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES UP ALREADY. OFTEN, THEY ASK TO SURRENDER TO ME PERSONALLY, THEIR TERROR OF ME BALANCED BY AN ALMOST RELIGIOUS AWE. I AM REMINDED OF HOW THE JAPANESE WERE REPORTED TO HAVE VIEWED THE ATOMIC BOMB, AFTER HIROSHIMA. IT’S JUNE, V.V.N. NIGHT, AND THE COMEDIAN IS SLIDING A GUN FROM ITS HOLSTER, BLOOD STREAMING FROM HIS LACERATED FACE...
IT’S OCTOBER, 1985. DECIDING TO CREATE SOMETHING, I TURN AWAY FROM STARS THAT MAY HAVE BURNED OUT EONS AGO. I NO LONGER WISH TO LOOK AT THEM. I NO LONGER WISH TO LOOK AT DEAD THINGS. IT’S 1975. THE PAPERS ARE FULL OF THE PRESIDENT’S PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, ALLOWING HIM TO RUN NEXT YEAR FOR A THIRD TERM. AMIDST ALL THIS, THE UNMASKING AND RETIREMENT OF OZYMANDIAS GOES ALMOST UNNOTICED. HIS REAL NAME IS ADRIAN VEIDT, A SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE. AFTER RETIRING FROM ADVENTURING HE INVITES LAURIE AND ME TO VISIT HIM AT HIS ANTARCTIC RETREAT. AND BY THEIR CONSCIENCES, SURELY? HIS EYES ARE SAD AND KNOWING. HIS SERVANTS BRING US INDONESIAN FOOD AND HE TALKS ABOUT HIS BUSINESS PLANS, ALL THE TIME FEEDING SCRAPS TO HIS BEAUTIFUL MONSTROUS CAT. IT’S 1985. CHOOSING A SPOT TO BEGIN MY CREATION, I SIT
 DOWN. PINK SAND LIES POOLED IN MY BLUE PALM. THIS DESERTED PLANET=IT IS SO WONDERFULLY, COMPLETELY SILENT. IN 1977, A CITY IS SHOUTING. CLAIMING THAT COSTUMED ADVENTURERS ARE MAKING THEIR JOB IMPOSSIBLE, THE POLICE ARE ON STRIKE. EVERYONE IS FRIGHTENED, SCENTING ANARCHY. BELOW ME, LAURIE HAULS THE RINGLEADERS FROM THE CROWD, BUT THE PROCESS IS TOO SLOW... I’D BEST DO SOMETHING... PAY ATTENTION. YOU WILL ALL RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME. IT WAS NOT A REQUEST. THE NEXT DAY, I AM READING IN THE PAPER OF TWO SUFFERED HEART ATTACKS UPON SUDDENLY FINDING THEMSELVES INDOORS. MORE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED DURING A RIOT, I’M CERTAIN. AUGUST 3R  D , 1977: THE EMERGENCY BILL PROPOSED BY SENATOR KEENE HAS BEEN PASSED. VIGILANTISM IS NOW ILLEGAL AGAIN, AS IT WAS BEFORE THEY ALTERED THE LAWS TO ACCOMMODATE STRATEGICALLY SUCH AS MYSELF. AS LONG AS I CONTINUE TO ACT UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION, I AM EXEMPT FROM THE LAW. THEY CAN HARDLY OUTLAW ME WHEN THEIR COUNTRY’S DEFENSE RESTS IN MY HANDS. BLAKE IS ALSO EXEMPT, SINCE HE TOO WORKS ENTIRELY FOR THE GOVERNMENT. LATER, AFTER HIS HANDLING OF THE IRANIAN HOSTAGE SITUATION, EVEN HIS HARSHEST CRITICS FALL SILENT. LAURIE STILL HATES HIM, HOWEVER. SHE HERSELF HAS BEEN FORCED TO RETIRE BY THE KEENE ACT, BUT HAVING NEVER REALLY ENJOYED THE LIFE, SHE DOESN’T MIND. HER MOTHER IS MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN SHE IS. THE NITE OWL HAS STATED THAT HE WILL BE RETURNING, ALTHOUGH HE WILL NOT BE MAKING HIS IDENTITY PUBLIC. LAURIE’S MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES. SHE SAYS HIS NAME IS DREIBERG. THE ONLY OTHER ACTIVE VIGILANTE IS CALLED RORSCHACH, REAL NAME UNKNOWN. HE EXPRESSES HIS FEELINGS TOWARD COMPULSORY RETIREMENT IN A NOTE LEFT OUTSIDE POLICE HEADQUARTERS ALONG WITH A DEAD MULTIPLE RAPIST. IT’S 1981 NOW. LAURIE AND I ARE SETTLING INTO OUR NEW QUARTERS AT THE ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER IN NEW YORK. IT’S WELL-EQUIPPED FOR MY WORK, BUT LAURIE FEELS WE’VE LOST OUR PRIVACY. SHE’D LIKE IT HERE. THROUGH MY BLUE FINGERS, PINK GRAINS ARE FALLING, HAPHAZARD, RANDOM, A DISORGANIZED STREAM OF SILICONE THAT SEEMS PREGNANT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EVERY CONCEIVABLE SHAPE... BUT THIS IS ILLUSION. THINGS HAVE THEIR SHAPE IN TIME, NOT SPACE ALONE. SOME MARBLE BLOCKS HAVE STATUES WITHIN THEM EMBEDDED IN THEIR FUTURE. IN NEW YORK, WE GO WALKING. THE STREETS SMELL OF OZONE RATHER THAN GASOLINE. FLAT INTANGIBLE BLOTS OF GRAY SLIDE ACROSS THE SUMMER SIDEWALKS, THE SHADOWS OF OVERHEAD AIRSHIPS. IN 1959, A CHILD IS WEEPING FOR ITS LOST BALLOONS. ANY MOMENT NOW, JANEY’S WATCHBAND WILL BREAK SOMEWHERE, THE FAT MAN IS ALREADY LUMBERING
 TOWARD THE SHOOTING GALLERY, STEPS HEAVY WITH UNWITTING DESTINY. IT’S AUGUST, 1985. I’M WALKING THROUGH GRAND CENTRAL STATION WITH LAURIE. WE STOP AT THE NEWSSTAND AND BUY A COPY OF TIME MAGAZINE, COMMEMORATING HIROSHIMA WEEK. ON THE COVER THERE IS A DAMAGED POCKET WATCH, STOPPED AT THE INSTANT OF THE BLAST, FACE CRACKED... ... HANDS FROZEN.
IT’S SATURDAY, OCTOBER 12T  H , 1985, AND WE ARE BEING INFORMED OF EDWARD BLAKE’S MURDER. LAURIE’S MOOD SEEMS RESTLESS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND. WEDNESDAY THE 16T  H . LAURIE IS VISITING HER MOTHER WHILE I ATTEND BLAKE’S FUNERAL. A THIN MAN IN BLACK COAT LEAVES ROSE, THEN WALKS AWAY. DO I KNOW HIM? SATURDAY THE 19T  H  NOW. MY HANDS ENCIRCLE LAURIE’S FACE... IN 1966, THE COSTUMED PEOPLE ARE ARGUING. IT’S LATER. LAURIE IS WALKING OUT ON ME. ON A ROOFTOP IN THE PAST, I PULL HER SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD BODY TO ME, BREATHING HER PERFUME, NEVER WANTING TO LOSE HER, KNOWING THAT I SHALL. LATER STILL, AND IN THE CROWDED T.V. STUDIO, I AM BEING ACCUSED OF KILLING THOSE CLOSEST TO ME. THE WORD “CANCER” RUNS THROUGH THE AUDIENCE ON A FIRECRACKER STRING OF ANXIOUS WHISPERS. I AM TIRED OF THIS OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE TANGLE OF THEIR LIVES. IN ARIZONA, I’M ENTERING THE RUINED BAR WITH A SENSATION OF DÉJÀ VU... ... AND I’M TAKING THE SNAPSHOT FROM ITS BROKEN FRAME... ...AND I’M GONE. GONE TO MARS. GONE TO A PLACE WITHOUT CLOCKS, WITHOUT SEASONS, WITHOUT HOURGLASSES TO TRAP THE SHIFTING PINK SAND. BELOW ME, IN THE SAND, THE SECRET SHAPE OF MY CREATION IS CONCEALED, BURIED IN THE SAND’S FUTURE. I RISE INTO THE THIN AIR.
I AM READY TO BEGIN. A WORLD GROWS UP AROUND ME. AM I SHAPING IT, OR DO ITS PREDETERMINED CONTOURS GUIDE MY HAND? A WORLD GROWS UP AROUND ME. AM I SHAPING IT, OR DO ITS PREDETERMINED CONTOURS GUIDE MY HAND? IN 1945, THE BOMBS ARE FALLING ON JAPAN, THE COGS ARE FALLING ON BROOKLYN, SEEDS OF THE FUTURE, SOWN CARELESSLY... WITHOUT ME, THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. IF THE FAT MAN HADN’T CRUSHED THE WATCH, IF I HADN’T LEFT IT IN THE TEST CHAMBER... AM I TO BLAME, THEN? OR THE FAT MAN? OR MY FATHER, FOR CHOOSING MY CAREER? WHICH OF US IS RESPONSIBLE? WHO MAKES THE WORLD? PERHAPS THE WORLD IS NOT MADE. PERHAPS NOTHING IS MADE. PERHAPS IT SIMPLY IS, HAS BEEN, WILL ALWAYS BE THERE... A CLOCK WITHOUT A CRAFTSMAN. I AM STANDING ON A BALCONY OF PINK SAND, HARDENED TO GLASS. IT GLITTERS IN THE TEN-MINUTE-OLD SUNSHINE. THE LIGHT OF TWO HOURS PAST WILL JUST BE REACHING PLUTO.
IF THEY HAVE STRONG TELESCOPES THERE, THEY CAN SEE ME; THE PHOTOGRAPH IN MY HAND, FALLING... LYING IN THE SAND AT MY FEET.
 I AM STANDING ON A FIRE ESCAPE IN 1945, REACHING OUT TO STOP MY FATHER, TAKE THE COGS AND FLYWHEELS FROM HIM, PIECE THEM ALL TOGETHER AGAIN... BUT IT’S TOO LATE, ALWAYS HAS BEEN, ALWAYS WILL BE TOO LATE. ABOVE THE NODUS GORDII MOUNTAINS, JEWELS IN A MAKERLESS MECHANISM, THE FIRST METEORITES ARE STARTING TO FALL. HELLO. I AM ON MARS. NOW I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CONVERSATION SCHEDULED. YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME. “THE GOD OUT OF THE MACHINE.” YES. YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS... ... BUT THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT FOR ME. PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND. AN HOUR INTO MY FUTURE WE’RE ON MARS, TALKING. I THOUGHT I’D COLLECT YOU IN READINESS.
BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE I AM. BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE OUR CONVERSATION IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. YOU’RE GOING TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME TO SAVE THE WORLD. THERE. DO YOU LIKE IT? LAURIE? LAURIE? WHAT’S...? OH. OF COURSE. PLEASE FORGIVE ME... SOMETIMES THESE THINGS SLIP MY MIND. LAURIE? ARE YOU ALRIGHT? OF COURSE. IT IS HERE ON MARS THAT WE DEBATE EARTH’S DESTINY. WHY DOES MY PERCEPTION OF TIME DISTRESS YOU? EVERYTHING IS PREORDAINED. EVEN MY RESPONSES. WE’RE ALL PUPPETS, LAURIE. I’M JUST A PUPPET WHO CAN SEE THE STRINGS. WE SHALL GO UP TO THE BALCONY. YOU CAN SEE THE NODUS GORDII MOUNTAINS FROM THERE. THIS IS WHERE WE HOLD OUR CONVERSATION. IT COMMENCES WHEN YOU SURPRISE ME WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU AND DREIBERG HAVE BEEN SLEEPING TOGETHER.
NO. NOT YET. BUT IN A FEW MOMENTS YOU’RE GOING TO TELL ME. DESTINY OF THE WORLD. BECAUSE. THERE IS NO FUTURE. THERE IS NO PAST DO YOU SEE? TIME IS SIMULTANEOUS, AND INTRICATELY STRUCTURED JEWEL THAT HUMANS INSIST ON VIEWING ONE EDGE AT A TIME, WHEN THE WHOLE DESIGN IS VISIBLE IN EVERY FACET. WHAT IS YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY? IT ISN’T GONE, IT’S STILL HERE. LET YOURSELF SEE IT. I SEE. THEN YOUR MOTHER’S HUSBAND WASN’T... AHH. LOOK OVER THERE: A DUST STORM RISING. YOU MEAN THAT YOU’RE SLEEPING WITH DREIBERG? I SAID, OFTEN, THAT YOU WERE MY ONLY LINK, MY ONLY CONCERN WITH THE WORLD. WHEN YOU LEFT ME, I LEFT EARTH. DOES THAT NOT SAY ANYTHING? NOW YOU HAVE REPLACED ME, AND THAT LINK IS SHATTERED. DON’T YOU SEE WHAT THAT MEANS? DON’T YOU SEE THE FUTILITY OF ASKING ME TO SAVE A WORLD THAT I NO LONGER HAVE ANY STAKE IN?
NOT TO ME. MY RED WORLD HERE MEANS MORE TO ME THAN YOUR BLUE ONE. I WILL SHOW YOU AROUND IT IF YOU WISH... AS YOU PLEASE. THERE ARE OTHER METHODS. NOR I. BELIEVE ME, I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES... ... THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE IN THE BOTTLE? AS YOU WISH. ALL THAT PAIN AND CONFLICT DONE WITH? ALL THAT NEEDLESS SUFFERING OVER AT LAST? NO... NO, THAT DOESN’T
 BOTHER ME. ALL THOSE GENERATIONS OF STRUGGLE, WHAT PURPOSE DID THEY EVER ACHIEVE? “ALL THAT EFFORT, AND WHAT DID IT EVER LEAD TO?”
IN MY OPINION, IT’S A HIGHLY OVERRATED PHENOMENON. MARS GETS ALONG PERFECTLY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A MICRO-ORGANISM. SEE: THERE’S THE SOUTH POLE BENEATH US NOW... NO LIFE. NO LIFE AT ALL, BUT GIANT STEPS, NINETY FEET HIGH, SCOURED BY DUST AND WIND INTO A CONSTANTLY CHANGING TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP, FLOWING AND SHIFTING AROUND THE POLE IN RIPPLES TEN THOUSAND YEARS WIDE. TELL ME... WOULD IT BE GREATLY IMPROVED BY AN OIL PIPELINE? NOT ENOUGH OXYGEN. I COULD EXTEND YOUR AURA... YOUR DEFINITION IS NARROW; LIFE INSISTING ON LIFE’S VIEWPOINT, WHEN ALTERNATIVES EXIST. THOSE JUMBLED BOX CANYONS BELOW, WHERE VOLCANOES BOILED THE PERMAFROST INTO SCALDING GEYSERS: ONCE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FOUNTAINS OF LIFE. THE GROUND CRUMBLED WHEN THE SUBTERRANEAN ICE MELTED, RELEASING TORRENTS OF WATER TO FORM VAST RIVERS, NOW LONG DRY. LIFE COULD HAVE FLOURISHED HERE THEN, BUT MARS DID NOT CHOOSE LIFE. IT CHOSE THIS. IT’S CALLED CHAOTIC TERRAIN. NO. I READ ATOMS, LAURIE. I SEE THE ANCIENT SPECTACLE THAT BIRTHED THE RUBBLE. BESIDE THIS, HUMAN LIFE IS BRIEF AND MUNDANE. IT ENDS WITH YOU IN TEARS... LOOK THERE: OLYMPUS MONS APPROACHES! I RETURN TO EARTH AT SOME POINT IN MY FUTURE. THERE ARE STREETS FULL OF CORPSES. THE DETAILS ARE VAGUE. I’M NOT SURE. THERE’S SOME SORT OF STATIC OBSCURING THE FUTURE, PREVENTING ANY CLEAR IMPRESSION. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE OF A MESS WARHEAD DETONATION MIGHT CONCEIVABLY CAUSE THAT...
BEYOND THAT, EVENTS GROW EVEN SKETCHIER: I AM STANDING IN DEEP SNOW... I AM KILLING SOMEONE. THEIR IDENTITY IS UNCERTAIN. LOOK AT IT: A VOLCANO AS LARGE AS MISSOURI, ITS SUMMIT FIFTEEN MILES HIGH, PIERCING EVEN THE ATMOSPHERIC BLANKET. BREATHTAKING. ...AND THE UNIVERSE WILL NOT EVEN NOTICE. WE’VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE, LAURIE. YOU ARGUES THAT HUMAN LIFE WAS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THIS EXCELLENT DESOLATION, AND I WAS NOT CONVINCED. YOU ATTEMPTED TO COMPARE THE MERE UNCERTAINTY IN YOUR EXISTENCE WITH THE CHAOS OF THE WORLD BENEATH US... BUT WHERE ARE THE PINNACLES TO RIVAL THIS OLYMPUS? WHERE ARE THE DEPTHS TO MATCH THOSE OF... AHH, BUT WE NEAR THE VALLES MARINERIS. YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELF. IT STRETCHES MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND MILES, SO THAT ONE END KNOWS DAY WHILE THE OTHER ENDURES NIGHT. TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES BREED SHRIEKING WINDS THAT HERD OCEANS OF FOG ALONG A CANYON FOUR MILES DEEP. DOES THE HUMAN HEART KNOW CHASMS SO ABYSMAL? YES. I REMEMBER A BANQUET IN 1973.
 LAURIE... NO “THERMODYNAMIC MIRACLES” ARE... ON THE ARGYRE PLANITIA? AS YOU WISH. PERFECTLY. LAURIE, YOU COMPLAIN PERHAPS RIGHTLY, THAT I WON’T SEE EXISTENCE IN HUMAN TERMS... BUT YOU YOURSELF REFUSE TO CONSIDER MY VIEWPOINT, LETTING YOUR EMOTIONS BLIND YOU. LOOK AT YOURSELF: ANGRY, SHOUTING... IF YOU’D ONLY RELAX ENOUGH TO SEE THE WHOLE CONTINUUM, LIFE’S PATTERN OR LACK OF ONE, THEN YOU’D UNDERSTAND MY PERSPECTIVE. YOU’RE DELIBERATELY SHUTTING OUT UNDERSTANDING AS IF YOU’RE AFRAID; AS IF YOU’RE TOO DELICATE.
I THINK YOU’RE AVOIDING SOMETHING. LAURIE? LAURIE? ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
I DON’T THINK YOUR LIFE’S MEANINGLESS. NO. I CHANGED MY MIND. THERMODYNAMIC MIRACLES... EVENTS WITH ODDS AGAINST SO ASTRONOMICAL THEY’RE EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE, LIKE OXYGEN SPONTANEOUSLY BECOMING GOLD. I LONG TO OBSERVE SUCH A THING. AND YET, IN EACH HUMAN COUPLING, A THOUSAND MILLION SPERM VIE FROM A SINGLE EGG. MULTIPLY THOSE ODDS BY COUNTLESS GENERATIONS AGAINST THE ODDS OF YOUR ANCESTORS BEING ALIVE; MEETING; SIRING THIS PRECISE SON; THAT EXACT DAUGHTER. ... UNTIL YOUR MOTHER LOVES A MAN SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO HATE, AND OF THAT UNION, OF THE THOUSAND MILLION CHILDREN COMPETING FOR FERTILIZATION, IT WAS YOU, ONLY YOU, THAT EMERGED. TO DISTILL SO SPECIFIC A FORM FROM THAT CHAOS OF IMPROBABILITY, LIKE TURNING AIR TO GOLD... THAT IS THE CROWNING UNLIKELIHOOD. THE THERMODYNAMIC MIRACLE. YES. ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. BUT THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF PEOPLE, SO CROWDED WITH THESE MIRACLES THAT THEY BECOME COMMONPLACE AND WE FORGET... I FORGET. WE GAZE CONTINUALLY AT THE WORLD AND IT GROWS DULL IN OUR PERCEPTIONS. YET SEEN FROM ANOTHER’S VANTAGE POINT, AS IF NEW, IT MAY STILL TAKE THE BREATH AWAY. COME... DRY YOUR EYES, FOR YOU ARE LIFE, RARER THAN A QUARK AND UNPREDICTABLE BEYOND THE DREAMS OF HEISENBERG; THE CLAY IN WHICH THE FORCES THAT SHAPE ALL THINGS LEAVE THEIR FINGERPRINTS MOST CLEARLY. DRY YOUR EYES. AND LET’S GO HOME. MIDNIGHT. MIDNIGHT, NOVEMBER SECOND. THAT’S UNUSUAL. I’D EXPECTED US TO REAPPEAR ON EARTH MUCH EARLIER. THE STATIC INTERFERENCE I NOTICED EARLIER MAKES EVERYTHING SO UNPREDICTABLE. OBVIOUSLY, IT WASN’T CAUSED BY A WARHEAD DETONATION. WHAT THEN? NOT TACHYONS, SURELY... YES! DEFINITELY! A SQUALL OF TACHYONS. WHERE CAN THEY BE COMING FROM? I’D ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE EXCITEMENT OF NOW KNOWING, THE DELIGHTS OF UNCERTAINTY... NOW, LET ME SEE... TACHYON PARTICLES, TRAVELLING BACKWARDS IN TIME, OCCUR RARELY. SOMEONE MUST BE GENERATING THEM. IF I PROBE FAR ENOUGH, I SHOULD STUMBLE UPON THE
 SOURCE OF THE DISTURBANCE... ... THOUGH THIS STATIC MAKES SCANNING DIFFICULT, ALSO, THERE’S APPARENTLY MORE THAN ONE GENERATOR.
MOST ARE FAINT, BUT A PULSE FROM THE SOUTHERN POLAR REGION IS STRONG... REASSURINGLY POWERFUL. LOGICALLY, WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE ANTARCTIC SIGNAL IMMEDIATELY, ASSESS ITS CONNECTION WITH THIS CATASTROPHE... WORKING BLIND, WE CAN’T USEFULLY PREPARE OURSELVES. OUR? CERTAINLY WE CAN TRACE THE TACHYONS TO THEIR SOURCE AND...
I’M SORRY HOW THOUGHTLESS OF ME. THIS MUST BE A DISTRESSING TIME FOR YOU... VEIDT. OF COURSE. WHO ELSE HAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF RESOURCES FOR TACHYON INTERFERENCE? HMM. EIGHT GENERATORS THROUGHOUT ANTARCTICA, EIGHT IN ORBITING SATELLITES. IT DISPLAYS REMARKABLE FORESIGHT, DON’T YOU THINK? AFTER ALL, SINCE TACHYONS ONLY AFFECT ME, HE’S OBVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED MY POSSIBLE DISCOVERY OF HIS PLOT FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME... YES. YES HE KILLED BLAKE AND HALF OF NEW YORK. EXCUSE ME, RORSCHACH. I’M INFORMING LAURIE NINETY SECONDS AGO. I-I’M SORRY. IT’S THESE TACHYONS. THEY’RE MUDDLING THINGS UP... I’D BETTER FOLLOW HIM INSIDE. YES. YES, HE KILLED BLAKE AND HALF OF NEW YORK. EXCUSE ME, RORSCHACH. I’M INFORMING LAURIE NINETY SECONDS AGO. I-I’M SORRY. IT’S THESE TACHYONS. THEY’RE MUDDLING THINGS UP... I’D BETTER FOLLOW HIM INSIDE. VEIDT? VEIDT, EVEN IF I CAN’T PREDICT WHERE I’M GOING TO FIND YOU, I CAN TURN THIS PLACE TO GLASS. YOU CAN’T HIDE. YOU’RE BEING STUPID. THE TACHYONS WERE CLEVER, BUT THIS STUPID. IT ISN’T LIKE YOU TO... AH. VERY WELL. IF I MUST... IF I MUST FOLLOW THIS THROUGH TO THE BITTER END. VEIDT? DON’T... I AM DISAPPOINTED, VEIDT. VERY DISAPPOINTED. RESTRUCTURING MYSELF AFTER THE SUBTRACTION OF MY INTRINSIC FIELD WAS THE FIRST TRICK I LEARNED. IT DIDN’T KILL OSTERMAN... DID YOU THINK IT WOULD KILL ME? I’VE WALKED ACROSS THE SUN. I’VE SEEN EVENTS SO TINY AND SO FAST THEY HARDLY CAN BE SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED AT ALL, BUT YOU... YOU ARE A MAN. AND THIS WORLD’S SMARTEST MAN MEANS NO MORE TO ME THAN DOES IT SMARTEST TERMITE. WHAT’S THAT IN YOUR HAND, VEIDT? ANOTHER ULTIMATE WEAPON? LOGICALLY, I’M AFRAID HE’S RIGHT EXPOSING THIS PLOT, WE DESTROY ANY CHANCE OF PEACE, DOOMING EARTH TO WORSE DESTRUCTION. ON MARS, YOU DEMONSTRATED LIFE’S VALUE. IF WE WOULD PRESERVE LIFE HERE, WE MUST REMAIN SILENT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? RORSCHACH... YOU KNOW I CAN’T LET YOU DO THAT. RORSCHACH. YOU NEEDN’T CONSIDER RORSCHACH. I STRONGLY DOUBT HE’LL REACH CIVILIZATION... BUT YES I UNDERSTAND, WITHOUT CONDONING OR CONDEMNING. HUMAN AFFAIRS CANNOT BE MY CONCERN. I’M LEAVING THIS GALAXY FOR ONE LESS COMPLICATED.
YES, I HAVE. I THINK PERHAPS I’LL CREATE SOME. GOODBYE, ADRIAN. “IN THE END?” NOTHING ENDS, ADRIAN. NOTHING EVER ENDS.
