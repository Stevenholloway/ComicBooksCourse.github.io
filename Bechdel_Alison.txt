LIKE MANY FATHERS, MINE COULD OCCASIONALLY BE PREVAILED FOR A SPOT OF “AIRPLANE.” AS HE LAUNCHED ME, MY FULL WEIGHT WOULD FALL ON THE PIVOT POINT BETWEEN HIS FEET AND MY STOMACH.  IT WAS A DISCOMFORT WELL WORTH THE RARE PHYSICAL CONTACT, AND CERTAINLY WORTH THE MOMENT OF PERFECT BALANCE WHEN I SOARED ABOVE HIM. IN THE CIRCUS, ACROBATICS WHERE ONE PERSON LIES ON THE FLOOR BALANCING ANOTHER ARE CALLED “ICARIAN GAMES.” CONSIDERING THE FATE OF ICARUS AFTER HE FLOUTED HIS FATHER’S ADVICE AND FLEW SO CLOSE TO THE SUN HIS WINGS MELTED, PERHAPS SOME DARK HUMOR IS INTENDED. IN OUR PARTICULAR REENACTMENT OF THIS MYTHIC RELATIONSHIP, IT WAS NOT ME BUT MY FATHER WHO WAS TO PLUMMET FROM THE SKY. BUT BEFORE HE DID SO. HE MANAGED TO GET QUITE A LOT DONE. HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT, ARGUABLY, WAS HIS MONOMANIACAL RESTORATION OF OUR OLD HOUSE. WHEN OTHER CHILDREN CALLED OUR HOUSE A MANSION, I WOULD DEMUR. I RESENTED THE IMPLICATION THAT MY FAMILY WAS RICH, OR UNUSUAL IN ANY WAY. IT’S JUST A HOUSE.
 
ONLY FOUR MONTHS EARLIER, I HAD MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MY PARENTS “I AM A LESBIAN.” MY HOMOSEXUALITY REMAINED AT THE POINT PURELY THEORETICAL, AN UNTESTED HYPOTHESIS. BUT IT WAS A HYPOTHESIS SO THOROUGH AND CONVINCING THAT I SAW NO REASON NOT TO SHARE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE NEWS WAS NOT RECEIVED AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED. THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF DIFFICULT LETTERS WITH MY MOTHER. THEN A PHONE CALL IN WHICH SHE DEALT A STAGGERING BLOW. SHE SAID “YOUR FATHER HAS HAD AFFAIRS WITH OTHER MEN.” WHAT? I’D BEEN UPSTAGED, DEMOTED FROM PROTAGONIST IN MY OWN DRAMA TO COMIC RELIEF IN MY PARENTS’ TRAGEDY. I HAD IMAGED MY CONFESSION AS AN EMANCIPATION FROM MY PARENTS, BUT INSTEAD I WAS PULLED BACK INTO THEIR ORBIT. AND WITH MY FATHER’S DEATH FOLLOWING SO HARD ON THE HEELS OF THIS DOLEFUL COMING-OUT PARTY,I COULD NOT HELP BUT ASSUME A CAUSE- AND-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. IF I HAD NOT FELT COMPELLED TO SHARE MY LITTLE SEXUAL DISCOVERY, PERHAPS THE SEMI WOULD HAVE PASSED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOUR MONTHS LATER. WHY HAD I TOLD THEM? I HADN’T EVEN HAD SEX WITH ANYONE YET. CONVERSELY, MY FATHER HAD BEEN HAVING SEX WITH MEN FOR YEARS AND NOT TELLING ANYONE. “WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS AND NOT DAD?” THE LINE THAT DAD DREW BETWEEN REALITY AND FICTION WAS INDEED A BLURRY ONE. TO UNDERSTAND THIS, ONE ONLY TO ENTER HIS LIBRARY.  FOR ANYONE BUT THE LANDED GENTRY TO REFER TO A ROOM IN THEIR HOUSE AS “THE LIBRARY” MIGHT SEEM AFFECTED. BUT THERE REALLY WAS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT. AND MY FATHER LIKED TO IMAGINE HIMSELF AS A NINETEENTH- CENTURY ARISTOCRAT OVER-SEEING HIS ESTATE FROM BEHIND THE LEATHER-TOPPED MAHOGANY AND BRASS SECOND-EMPIRE DESK..DID THAT REQUIRE SUCH A LEAP OF THE IMAGINATION? PERHAPS AFFECTION CAN BE THOROUGHGOING, SO AUTHENTIC IN ITS DETAIL, THAT IT STOPS BEING PRETENSE...AND BECOMES FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, REAL. 

MY MOTHER’S TALENTS WERE NO LESS DAUNTING. ONCE I WENT WITH HER TO A HOUSE WHERE SHE ARGUED WITH A STRANGE MAN, AS IF SHE KNEW HIM INTIMATELY. THIS WAS ACTING. SHE COULD ALSO PLAY ASTONISHING THINGS ON THE PIANO, EVEN THE MUSIC FROM THE DOWNY COMMERCIAL ON TV. SEVERAL YEARS AFTER DAD DIED, MOM WAS USING OUR OLD TAPE RECORDER TO REHEARSE FOR A PLAY. SHE READ FROM THE SCRIPT, LEAVING PAUSES WHERE IT WAS HER CHARACTER’S TURN TO SPEAK. WHEN SHE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THE MACHINE WAS RECORDING PROPERLY, SHE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS TAPING OVER MY FATHER’S VOICE. IT’S JARRING TO HEAR MY FATHER SPEAK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. BUT THE MOST ARRESTING THING ABOUT THE TAPE IS ITS EVIDENCE OF BOTH MY PARENTS AT WORK, INTENT AND SEPARATE. THEIR RAPT IMMERSION EVOKES A FAMILIAR RESENTMENT IN ME. IT’S CHILDISH PERHAPS, TO GRUDGE THEM THE SUSTENANCE OF THEIR CREATIVE SOLITUDE. BUT IT WAS ALL THAT SUSTAINED THEM, AND WAS THUS ALL-CONSUMING. FROM THEIR EXAMPLE, I LEARNED QUICKLY TO FEED MYSELF. IT WAS A VICIOUS CYCLE, THOUGH. THE MORE GRATIFICATION WE FOUND IN OUR OWN GENIUSES, THE MORE ISOLATED WE GREW.

CAN I WRITE IN IT? WHAT THE FUCK? I’M A LESBIAN. YOU’VE DONE ENOUGH. YOU SHOULD GO. HE GOT -- HA HA HA -- HIT BY A TRUCK!
