DOG CARCASS IN ALLEY THIS MORNING, TIRE TREAD ON BURST STOMACH. THIS CITY IS AFRAID OF ME. I HAVE SEEN ITS TRUE FACE. THE STREETS ARE EXTENDED GUTTERS AND THE GUTTERS ARE FULL OF BLOOD AND WHEN THE DRAINS FINALLY SCAB OVER, ALL THE VERMIN WILL DROWN. THE ACCUMULATED FILTH OF ALL THEIR SEX AND MURDER WILL FOAM UP ABOUT THEIR WAISTS AND ALL THE WHORES AND POLITICIANS WILL LOOK UP AND SHOUT ‘SAVE US!’... AND I’LL LOOK DOWN AND WHISPER ‘NO.’ THEY HAD A CHOICE, ALL OF THEM. THEY COULD HAVE FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF GOOD MEN LIKE MY FATHER, OR PRESIDENT TRUMAN. DECENT MEN, WHO BELIEVED IN A DAY’S WORK FOR A DAY’S PAY. INSTEAD THEY FOLLOWED THE DROPPINGS OF LECHERS AND COMMUNISTS AND DIDN’T REALIZE THAT THE TRAIL LED OVER A PRECIPICE UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. DON’T TELL ME THEY DIDN’T HAVE A CHOICE. NOW THE WHOLE WORLD STANDS ON THE BRINK, STARING DOWN INTO BLOODY HELL, ALL THOSE LIBERALS AND INTELLECTUALS AND SMOOTH-TALKERS... AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN, NOBODY CAN THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY.”... “HUNH. EHH. HURM.”... “HELLO, DANIEL.
 GOT HUNGRY WAITING. HELPED MYSELF TO SOME BEANS. HOPE YOU DON’T MIND.”... “NO NEED. FINE LIKE THIS.”... “OUT OF PRISON SO FAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.”... “THAT’S RIGHT. HUMAN BEAN JUICE. HA HA. BADGE BELONGED TO THE COMEDIAN. BLOOD TOO. HE’S DEAD.”... “INVESTIGATED A ROUTINE HOMICIDE. VICTIM NAMED EDWARD BLAKE. FOUND THE COSTUME IN BLAKE’S WARDROBE. SEEMS HE WAS THE COMEDIAN. SOMEBODY THREW HIM OUT OF A WINDOW.”... “NEITHER HAVE YOU. LOT OF DUST.”... “AN ORDINARY BURGLAR? KILL THE COMEDIAN? RIDICULOUS.”... “MAYBE. OR MAYBE SOMEONE’S PICKING OFF COSTUMED HEROES.”... “THAT’S WHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT ME NOW? THAT I’M PARANOID? THE COMEDIAN WAS ACTIVE FOR FORTY YEARS. MEN MAKE A LOT OF ENEMIES IN THAT TIME. HOW’S YOUR FRIEND HOLLIS MASON THESE DAYS?”... “THEY WERE BOTH MINUTEMEN. WHEN BLAKE WAS SIXTEEN AND MASON WAS THE FIRST NITE OWL. THAT BOOK MASON WROTE. HE SAID SOME BAD THINGS ABOUT THE COMEDIAN IN IT.”... “IMPLYING NOTHING. JUST AN OBSERVATION.”... “ANYWAY, THOUGHT I’D LET YOU KNOW. IN CASE SOMEBODY’S GUNNING FOR MASKS. BETTER GO NOW. THINGS TO DO.”... “YES. I REMEMBER. USED TO COME HERE OFTEN. BACK WHEN WE WERE PARTNERS.”... “YOU QUIT.”... “SLEPT ALL DAY. AWOKEN AT 4:37. LANDLADY COMPLAINING ABOUT SMELL. SHE HAS FIVE CHILDREN BY FIVE DIFFERENT FATHERS. I AM SURE SHE CHEATS ON WELFARE. SOON IT WILL BE DARK. BENEATH ME, THIS AWFUL CITY, IT SCREAMS LIKE AN ABATTOIR FULL OF RETARDED CHILDREN. NEW YORK. ON FRIDAY NIGHT, A COMEDIAN DIED IN NEW YORK. SOMEBODY KNOWS WHY. DOWN THERE... SOMEBODY KNOWS. THE DUSK REEKS OF FORNICATION AND BAD CONSCIENCES. I BELIEVE I SHALL TAKE MY EXERCISE.”... “I’M FINE, HAPPY HARRY. YOURSELF?”... “GUY WENT SIDEWALK DIVING, FRIDAY NIGHT. I DON’T THINK HE WAS ALONE WHEN IT HAPPENED. NAME WAS EDWARD BLAKE. FRIEND OF MINE.”... “I’VE JUST BROKEN THIS GENTLEMAN’S LITTLE FINGER. WHO KILLED EDWARD BLAKE?”... “AND HIS INDEX FINGER. WHO KILLED EDWARD BLAKE?”... “HURM.”... “FIRST VISIT OF THE EVENING FRUITLESS. NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING. FEEL SLIGHTLY DEPRESSED. THIS CITY IS DYING OF RABIES. IS THE BEST I CAN DO TO WIPE RANDOM FLECKS OF FOAM FROM ITS LIPS? NEVER DESPAIR. NEVER SURRENDER. I LEAVE THE HUMAN COCKROACHES TO DISCUSS THEIR HEROIN AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE, WITH A BETTER CLASS OF PERSON.”... “YOU WERE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WORLD’S SMARTEST MAN, VEIDT. YOU TELL ME.”... “DREIBERG SAID SAME THING. I DON’T BELIEVE IT. AMERICA HAS DR. MANHATTAN. REDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING SCARED SINCE ‘65. THEY’D NEVER DARE ANTAGONIZE US. I THINK WE’VE GOT A MASK-KILLER.”... “HE STOOD UP FOR HIS COUNTRY, VEIDT. HE NEVER LET ANYBODY RETIRE HIM. NEVER
 CASHED IN ON HIS REPUTATION. NEVER SET UP A COMPANY SELLING POSTERS AND DIET BOOKS AND TOY SOLDIERS BASED ON HIMSELF. NEVER BECAME A PROSTITUTE. IF THAT MAKES HIM A NAZI, YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL ME A NAZI, TOO.”... “YES. GOOD TIMING. I CAME HERE TO WARN YOU ABOUT THE MASK-KILLER. SO YOU DIDN’T END UP SMARTEST MAN IN THE MORGUE. BUT I GUESS THERE’S WORSE THINGS TO END UP AS. BE SEEING YOU.”... “MEETING WITH VEIDT LEFT BAD TASTE IN MOUTH. HE IS PAMPERED AND DECADENT, BETRAYING EVEN HIS OWN SHALLOW, LIBERAL AFFECTIONS. POSSIBLY HOMOSEXUAL? MUST REMEMBER TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. DREIBERG AS BAD. A FLABBY FAILURE WHO SITS WHIMPERING IN HIS BASEMENT. WHY ARE SO FEW OF US LEFT ACTIVE, HEALTHY, AND WITHOUT PERSONALITY DISORDERS? THE FIRST NITE OWL RUNS AN AUTO-REPAIR SHOP. THE FIRST SILK SPECTRE IS A BLOATED, AGING WHORE, DYING IN A CALIFORNIA RESORT. CAPTAIN METROPOLIS WAS DECAPITATED IN A CAR CRASH BACK IN ‘74. MOTHMAN’S IN AN ASYLUM UP IN MAINE. THE SILHOUETTE RETIRED IN DISGRACE, MURDERED SIX WEEKS LATER BY A MINOR ADVERSARY SEEKING REVENGE. DOLLAR BILL GOT SHOT. HOODED JUSTICE WENT MISSING IN ‘55. THE COMEDIAN IS DEAD. ONLY TWO NAMES REMAINING ON MY LIST. BOTH SHARE PRIVATE QUARTERS AT ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. I SHALL GO TO THEM. I SHALL GO AND TELL THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN THAT SOMEONE PLANS TO MURDER HIM.”... “GOOD EVENING, DR. MANHATTAN.”... “EHH. GOOD EVENING, MISS JUPITER.”... “APOLOGIES. CAME TO YOU BOTH AND BRING BAD NEWS. THE COMEDIAN IS DEAD.”... “HAVE MY OWN THEORIES ON THAT. TAKE IT YOU’RE NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT BLAKE’S DEATH.”... “ENNK.”... “UHM. SO YOU SUPPORT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN HOLLIS MASON’S BOOK CONCERNING BLAKE?”... “I’M NOT HERE TO SPECULATE ON THE MORAL LAPSES OF MEN WHO DIED IN THEIR COUNTRY’S SERVICE. I CAME TO WARN...”... “WITH RESPECT, DR. MANHATTAN, I WARNED VEIDT AND DREIBERG AND I INTEND TO WARN YOU AND YOUR LADY FRIEND. I BELIEVE SOMEONE IS ELIMINATING MASKED ADVENTURERS, POSSIBLY SOME OLD FOE WITH A GRUDGE. I BELIEVE...”... “SPENT A LOT OF TIME GETTING IN TO SEE YOU. NOT LEAVING BEFORE I’VE.. HAD MY SAY. HURM.”... “ON FRIDAY NIGHT, A COMEDIAN DIED IN NEW YORK. SOMEONE THREW HIM OUT OF A WINDOW AND WHEN HE HIT THE SIDEWALK HIS HEAD WAS DRIVEN INTO HIS STOMACH. NOBODY CARES. NOBODY CARES BUT ME. ARE THEY RIGHT? IS IT FUTILE? SOON THERE WILL BE WAR. MILLIONS WILL BURN. MILLION WILL PERISH IN SICKNESS AND MISERY. WHY DOES ONE DEATH MATTER AGAINST SO MANY? BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD AND THERE IS EVIL, AND EVIL MUST BE PUNISHED. EVEN IN THE FACE OF ARMAGEDDON I SHALL NOT COMPROMISE IN THIS. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
 DESERVING OF RETRIBUTION... AND THERE IS SO LITTLE TIME.”... “OBVIOUSLY, I AGREE- BUT A GROUP THIS SIZE SEEMS MORE LIKE A PUBLICITY EXERCISE SOMEHOW. IT’S TOO BIG AND UNWIELDY...”... “WELL, OF COURSE IT MATTERS. IF...”... “NO. EDGAR WILLIAM JACOBI, ALSO KNOWN AS EDGAR WILLIAM VAUGHN, ALSO KNOWN AS WILLIAM EDGAR BRIGHT... ALSO KNOWN AS MOLOCH.”... “LYING. DO IT AGAIN, BROKEN ARM. NOT JOKING.”... “HEARD YOU ATTENDED FUNERAL TODAY. WHY?”... “HOW? HOW DO YOU KNOW EDWARD BLAKE WAS THE COMEDIAN?”... “ENEMIES FOR FORTY YEARS. WHY SHOULD HE VISIT YOU?”... “HURM. FUNNY STORY. SOUNDS UNBELIEVABLE. PROBABLY TRUE.”... “CLEAN? YOU? SEARCHED YOUR HOUSE, BEFORE YOU GOT BACK. KNEW YOU WOULDN’T MIND. FOUND ILLEGAL DRUGS.”... “LAETRIL. PHONY MEDICATION. MADE FROM APRICOT PITS OUTLAWED THREE YEARS AGO. ILLEGAL.”... “CANCER? WHAT KIND CANCER?”... “YES.”... “HUHNH. VERY WELL. COPIED DOWN NAME OF COMPANY. REPORT THEM LATER. YOU’RE OFF HOOK. FOR NOW. BE SEEING YOU. KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE.”... “42ND STREET: WOMEN’S BREASTS DRAPED ACROSS EVERY BILLBOARD, EVERY DISPLAY, LITTERING THE SIDEWALK. WAS OFFERED SWEDISH LOVE AND FRENCH LOVE... BUT NOT AMERICAN LOVE. AMERICAN LOVE; LIKE COKE IN GREEN GLASS BOTTLES... THEY DON’T MAKE IT ANYMORE. THOUGHT ABOUT MOLOCH’S STORY, ON THE WAY TO CEMETERY. COULD ALL BE LIES. COULD ALL BE PART OF REVENGE SCHEME, PLANNED DURING HIS DECADE BEHIND BARS. BUT IF TRUE, THEN WHAT? PUZZLING REFERENCE TO AN ISLAND. ALSO TO DR. MANHATTAN. MIGHT HE BE AT RISK IN SOME WAY? SO MANY QUESTIONS. NEVER MIND. ANSWERS SOON. NOTHING IS INSOLUBLE. NOTHING IS HOPELESS. NO WHILE THERE’S LIFE. IN THE CEMETERY, ALL THE WHILE CROSSES STOOD IN ROWS, NEAT CHALK MARKS ON A GIANT SCORECARD. PAID LAST RESPECTS QUIETLY, WITHOUT FUSS. EDWARD MORGAN BLAKE. BORN 1924. FORTY-FIVE YEARS A COMEDIAN, DIED IN 1985, BURIED IN THE RAIN. IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO US? A LIFE OF CONFLICT WITH NO TIME FOR FRIENDS... SO THAT WHEN IT’S DONE, ONLY OUR ENEMIES LEAVE ROSES. VIOLENT LIVES, ENDING VIOLENTLY. DOLLAR BILL, THE SILHOUETTE, CAPTAIN METROPOLIS... WE NEVER DIE IN BED. NOT ALLOWED. SOMETHING IN OUR PERSONALITIES, PERHAPS? SOME ANIMAL URGE TO FIGHT AND STRUGGLE, MAKING US WHAT WE ARE? UNIMPORTANT. WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. OTHERS BURY THEIR HEADS BETWEEN THE SWOLLEN TEATS OF INDULGENCE AND GRATIFICATION, PIGLETS SQUIRMING BENEATH A SOW FOR SHELTER... BUT THERE IS NO SHELTER... AND THE FUTURE IS BEARING DOWN LIKE AN EXPRESS TRAIN. BLAKE UNDERSTOOD. TREATED IT LIKE A JOKE, BUT HE UNDERSTOOD. HE SAW THE CRACKS IN SOCIETY, SAW THE LITTLE MEN IN MASKS TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER... HE SAW THE TRUE FACE OF THE
 TWENTIETH CENTURY AND CHOSE TO BECOME A REFLECTION, A PARODY OF IT. NO ONE ELSE SAW THE JOKE. THAT’S WHY HE WAS LONELY. HEARD JOKE ONCE: MAN GOES TO DOCTOR. SAYS HE’S DEPRESSED. SAYS LIFE SEEMS HARSH AND CRUEL. SAYS HE FEELS ALL ALONE IN A THREATENING WORLD WHERE WHAT LIES AHEAD IS VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN. DOCTOR SAYS ‘TREATMENT IS SIMPLE. GREAT CLOWN PAGLIACCI IS IN TOWN TONIGHT. GO AND SEE HIM. THAT SHOULD PICK YOU UP.’ MAN BURSTS INTO TEARS. SAYS ‘BUT, DOCTOR... I AM PAGLIACCI.’ GOOD JOKE. EVERYBODY LAUGH. ROLL ON SNARE DRUM... CURTAINS.”... “GIVE ME A GAZETTE, AS WELL.”... “HOW ABOUT YOU? I SEE THE WORLD DIDN’T END YESTERDAY.”... “ARE YOU SURE?”... “GOOD MORNING, DANIEL. BROUGHT YOU YOUR SUNDAY PAPER. THE COMEDIAN MURDERED, DR, MANHATTAN EXILED... TWO OF US GONE. ALL WITHIN A WEEK. WHO NEXT? VEIDT? JUSPECZYK? ME? YOU? BY THE WAY, YOU NEED A STRONGER LOCK. THAT NEW ONE BROKE AFTER ONE SHOVE.”... “POOR CHOICE. GET MORE EXPENSIVE ONE. CAN’T BE TOO SECURITY CONSCIOUS. ESPECIALLY NOT THESE DAYS. THESE DAYS, NOBODY’S SAFE. BE SEEING YOU. THANKS FOR THE COFFEE AND CEREAL.”... “GUN. NO LICENSE. I CHECKED. VERY BAD. ALSO, YOU’RE SWEATING. LOOKS UNPLEASANT. SHOULD COOL DOWN.”... “NOTHING. JUST PASSING. OLD AND ALONE. THOUGHT YOU MIGHT APPRECIATE COMPANY.”... “NO. THOUGHT WE MIGHT DISCUSS COMEDIAN. HE VISITED HERE MENTIONED A LIST: YOU AND JANEY SLATER ON IT. TALKED ABOUT SOMEONE MESSING WITH DR. MANHATTAN. DAYS LATER, MANHATTAN PUBLICLY DISGRACED. FORCED INTO EXILE. ALLEGATIONS HE’D GIVEN PEOPLE CANCER: YOU, JANEY SLATER. TOUGH BREAK.”... “BECAUSE I THINK BLAKE’S LIST WAS CANCER LIST. SOMEBODY WROTE IT. SOMEBODY PUT YOUR NAME ON IT. SOMEBODY GAVE IT TO THE MEDIA. WONDER WHO? FUNNY... DR. MANHATTAN AND COMEDIAN WERE ALWAYS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMIES NOW THEY’RE BOTH GONE. VERY CONVENIENT. WHO IS IT, MOLOCH? WHO’S BEHIND THIS?”... “NO GOOD. WRONG TONE OF VOICE. NOT CONVINCING ENOUGH.”... “HURMM. BETTER.”... “GOING NOW. IF ANYTHING SHOULD REFRESH YOUR MEMORY CONTACT ME BY LEAVING NOTE, TRASH CAN OPPOSITE GUNGA DINER, AT FORTIETH AND SEVENTH. PLUS, GET GUN LICENSE SOON.”... “SORRY ABOUT MESS. CAN’T MAKE OMELETTE WITHOUT BREAKING FEW EGGS.”... “LEFT JACOBI’S HOUSE 2:35 A.M. HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT DR. MANHATTAN. HE HAS SIMPLY BEEN USED. BY WHOM? RUSSIANS SEEMS OBVIOUS CHOICE: MANHATTAN AND COMEDIAN BOTH KEY MILITARY FIGURES. BUT COMEDIAN REFERRED TO AN ISLAND, ARTISTS AND WRITERS LIVING ON IT. DOESN’T FIT. CAN’T CONCENTRATE. TOO TIRED. NO SLEEP SINCE SATURDAY. WALKED HOME PAST TRASH CANS STUFFED WITH RUMORS OF WAR WEIGHING FACTORS;
 BODIES; MOTIVES... WAITING FOR A FLASH OF ENLIGHTENMENT IN ALL THIS BLOOD AND THUNDER.”... “WOKEN AT ELEVEN BY SHOUTING OUTSIDE. DISTURBED TO FIND I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT REMOVING THE SKIN FROM MY HEAD. TIREDER THAN I THOUGHT. SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL. ACROSS STREET, BOYS WITH SPRAY CANS WERE DEFACING ABANDONED BUILDING. MEMORIZED THEIR DESCRIPTIONS, THEN PREPARED FOR WORK. FIRST, PEELED OFF FACE, FOLDED IT, HIS INSIDE JACKET. WITHOUT MY FACE, NOBODY KNOWS. ON WAY OUT OF ROOM, MET LANDLADY. USUAL COMPLAINTS RE HYGIENE AND RENT. THERE WERE PURPLE BITE MARKS ON HER WHITE NECK. FRESH ONES. SHE REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER. OUT IN THE STREET, INSPECTED DEFACED BUILDING: SILHOUETTE PICTURE IN DOORWAY, MAN AND WOMAN, POSSIBLY INDULGING IN SEXUAL FOREPLAY. DIDN’T LIKE IT. MAKES DOORWAY LOOK HAUNTED. ON FORTIETH AND SEVENTH SAW DREIBERG AND JUSPECZYK LEAVING DINER. THEY DIDN’T KNOW ME. AN AFFAIR, PERHAPS? DID JUSPECZYK ENGINEER DR. MANHATTAN’S EXILE TO MAKE ROOM FOR DREIBERG? ALSO, SHE HATED COMEDIAN. MUST INVESTIGATE FURTHER. ENTERING DINER, BOUGHT COFFEE, THEN SAT WATCHING MY MAILDROP, IMMEDIATELY ACROSS STREET. PASSERS-BY MADE VARIOUS DEPOSITS: CANDY WRAPPERS, NEWSPAPERS, A PAIR OF KEDS STRANGLED BY OWN LACES, TONGUES LOLLING OUT HORRIBLY. THIS CITY IS AN ANIMAL, FIERCE AND COMPLICATED. TO UNDERSTAND IT I READ ITS DROPPINGS, ITS SCENTS, THE MOVEMENT OF ITS PARASITES... I SAT WATCHING THE TRASH CAN, AND NEW YORK OPENED ITS HEART TO ME.”... “SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL VEIDT. PROVES ‘MASK KILLER’ THEORY. MURDERER IS CLOSING IN. CHECKED MAILDROP MESSAGE FROM MOLOCH. CONNECTED PERHAPS? NEXT, WENT TO RETRIEVE FACE FROM ALLEY, OUTSIDE UTOPIA, POLICE RESTRAINED A YOUTH ON KT-285. HE WAS SCREAMING SOMETHING ABOUT PRESIDENT NIXON. SOMETHING ABOUT BOMBS. IS EVERYONE BUT ME GOING MAD? OVER 40TH STREET, AN ELEPHANT WAS DRIFTING. BEYOND THAT UNSEEN, SPY SATELLITES. IF THEY SO MUCH AS NARROW THEIR GLASS EYES, WE SHALL ALL BE DEAD. THIS RELENTLESS WORLD: THERE IS ONLY ONE SANE RESPONSE TO IT. THE ALLEYWAY WAS COLD AND DESERTED. MY THINGS WERE WHERE I’D LEFT THEM. WAITING FOR ME. PUTTING THEM ON, I ABANDONED MY DISGUISE AND BECAME MYSELF, FREE FROM FEAR OR WEAKNESS OR LUST. MY COAT, MY SHOES, MY SPOTLESS GLOVES. MY FACE. HAD THREE HOURS BEFORE CALLING ON MOLOCH. AWAY DOWN ALLEY, HEARD WOMAN SCREAM, FIRST BUBBLING NOTE OF CITY’S EVENING CHORUS. APPROACHED DISTURBANCE AN ATTEMPTED RAPE/MUGGING/BOTH. CLEARED THROAT. THE MAN TURNED AND THERE WAS SOMETHING REWARDING IN HIS EYES. SOMETIMES, THE NIGHT IS GENEROUS TO ME.”... “ELEVEN THIRTY. GOOD EVENING, JACOBI. GOT YOUR
 NOTE. BEEN WONDERING WHY YOU WANTED TO SEE ME. SOMEBODY TRIED TO SHOOT THE WORLD’S SMARTEST MAN TODAY. HEAR ABOUT THAT? THE COMEDIAN, DR. MANHATTAN, OZYMANDIAS... SOMEBODY’S KILLING MASKS, JACOBI. SOMEBODY WANTS US DEAD. MAYBE SOME OLD ENEMY. MAYBE SOMEONE YOU MET IN PRISON. BEEN RUNNING THROUGH NAMES.WAS IT UNDERBOSS? WAS IT JIMMY THE GIMMICK OR THE KING OF SKIN? LOT OF QUESTIONS. NO ANSWERS. MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN ME.”... “NO. NO, NO, NO. FRAMED. SET UP. WALKED RIGHT INTO IT. STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. HEHN. NEVER. NEVER SURRENDER.”... “WEAPONS. YES...”... “WHEN YOU ARE.”... “RRAAAARRL.”... “KAAAH!”... “UUUW... NO. NO PAIN. GET UP. MUST GET UP. BEEN FRAMED... WHO? WHO HAS DONE THIS TO ME? GET UP. GET UP. GET UP GET...”... “UUK. AAANH. NO!

MOMMEEEE!”... “SOME NICE FLOWERS.”... “I... I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING. FROM THE STORE. FOR MY MOTHER...”... “LET ME BY. I HAVE TO GO TO...”... “EHHAHAHAHAHA!”... “YOU KEEP CALLING ME WALTER. I DON’T LIKE YOU.”... “FAT. WEALTHY. THINK YOU UNDERSTAND PAIN. I’LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, DOCTOR. I’LL TELL YOU ABOUT RORSCHACH.”... “1956. AGED 16. LEFT CHILDREN’S HOME.

NOT UGLY AT ALL. BLACK AND WHITE. MOVING, CHANGING SHAPE... BUT NOT MIXING. NO GRAY. VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL. NOBODY WANTED IT. MEANT FOR ME. TOOK IT HOME. LEARNED TO CUT IT USING HEATED IMPLEMENTS TO RESEAL LATEX. WHEN I HAD CUT IT ENOUGH, IT DIDN’T LOOK LIKE A WOMAN ANYMORE. SOON, BECAME BORED. FABRIC HAD NO USE LEFT IT IN TRUNK. FORGOT ABOUT IT. TWO YEARS PASSED. MARCH 1964. STOPPED AT NEWSSTAND ON WAY TO WORK, BOUGHT PAPER. THERE SHE WAS. FRONT PAGE. WOMAN WHO’S ORDERED SPECIAL DRESS. KITTY GENOVESE. I’M SURE THAT WAS THE WOMAN’S NAME. RAPED, TORTURED, KILLED, HERE IN NEW YORK. OUTSIDE HER OWN APARTMENT BUILDING. ALMOST FORTY NEIGHBORS HEARD SCREAMS. NOBODY DID ANYTHING. NOBODY CALLED COPS. SOME OF THEM EVEN WATCHED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SOME OF THEM EVEN WATCHED. I KNEW WHAT PEOPLE WERE, THEN, BEHIND ALL THE EVASIONS, ALL THE SELF-DECEPTION. ASHAMED FOR HUMANITY, I WENT HOME. I TOOK THE REMAINS OF HER UNWANTED DRESS... AND MADE A FACE THAT I COULD BEAR
 TO LOOK AT IN THE MIRROR.”... “LIKE YOU?”... “NO. YOU JUST THINK IT. THINK YOU’RE ‘GOOD’ PEOPLE! WHY ARE YOU SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WITH ME, DOCTOR?”... “OTHER PEOPLE, DOWN IN CELLS. BEHAVIOR MORE EXTREME THAN MINE. YOU DON’T SPEND ANY TIME WITH THEM... BUT THEN THEY’RE NOT FAMOUS. WON’T GET YOUR NAME IN JOURNALS. YOU DON’T WANT TO MAKE ME WELL. JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES ME SICK. YOU’LL FIND OUT. HAVE PATIENCE, DOCTOR. YOU’LL FIND OUT.”... “DON’T BE STUPID. I WASN’T RORSCHACH THEN. THEN I WAS JUST KOVACS. KOVACS PRETENDING TO BE RORSCHACH. BEING RORSCHACH TAKES CERTAIN KIND OF INSIGHT. BACK THEN, JUST THOUGHT I WAS RORSCHACH. VERY NAIVE. VERY YOUNG. VERY SOFT.”... “SOFT ON SCUM. TOO YOUNG TO KNOW ANY BETTER. MOLLY-CODDLED THEM. LET THEM LIVE.”... “LIKE I SAY, SOFT. HADN’T REALIZED THE STAKES WE WERE PLAYING FOR BACK THEN. ALL OF US... ME, MY FRIENDS: ALL SOFT.”... “KOVACS HAD FRIENDS. OTHER MEN IN COSTUMES. ALL KOVACS EVER WAS: MAN IN A COSTUME. NOT RORSCHACH. NOT RORSCHACH AT ALL. IN 1965, WORKED WITH NITE OWL BRINGING THE STREET GANGS UNDER CONTROL. TACKLED THE BIG FIGURE TOGETHER. BROUGHT DOWN UNDERBOSS TOGETHER. GOOD TEAM. UNTIL HE GOT SOFT, LIKE REST. UNTIL HE QUIT. NO STAYING POWER. NONE OF THEM. EXCEPT COMEDIAN. MET HIM IN 1966. FORCEFUL PERSONALITY. DIDN’T CARE IF PEOPLE LIKE HIM. UNCOMPROMISING. ADMIRED THAT. OF US ALL, HE UNDERSTOOD MOST. ABOUT WORLD. ABOUT PEOPLE. ABOUT SOCIETY AND WHAT’S HAPPENING TO IT. THINGS EVERYONE KNOWS IN GUT. THINGS EVERYONE TOO SCARED TO FACE, TOO POLITE TO TALK ABOUT. HE UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTOOD MAN’S CAPACITY FOR HORRORS AND NEVER QUIT. SAW THE WORLD’S BLACK UNDERBELLY AND NEVER SURRENDERED. ONCE A MAN HAS SEEN, HE CAN NEVER TURN HIS BACK ON IT. NEVER PRETEND IT DOESN’T EXIST.

 ARRIVED THERE AT DUSK. NO LIGHTS ON IN BUILDING. SOMETHING WAS MAKING NOISE IN WASTELAND AT REAR. ATTACK DOGS. TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS, FIGHTING OVER KNOB OF BONE. DIDN’T SEEM INTERESTED IN ME. DECIDED NOT TO USE REAR ENTRANCE ANYWAY. WENT THROUGH FRONT, LIKE RESPECTABLE VISITOR. SHOCK OF IMPACT RAN ALONG MY ARM. JET OF WARMTH SPATTERED ON CHEST, LIKE HOT FAUCET. IT WAS KOVACS WHO SAID ‘MOTHER’ THEN, MUFFLED UNDER LATEX. IT WAS KOVACS WHO CLOSED HIS EYES. IT WAS RORSCHACH WHO OPENED THEM AGAIN. ACCORDING TO MY INFORMANT, MAN USING PREMISES NAMES GERALD GRICE. OUT DRINKING WHEN I CALLED. RETURNED TO DRESSMAKERS AT TEN FORTY FIVE. DARK BY THEN. DARK AS IT GETS.”... “YES. SHOULDN’T BOTHER TRYING TO SAW THROUGH HANDCUFFS.

FELT DARK PLANET TURN UNDER MY FEET AND KNEW WHAT CATS KNOW THAT MAKES THEM SCREAM LIKE BABIES IN NIGHT. LOOKED AT SKY THROUGH SMOKE HEAVY WITH HUMAN FAT AND GOD WAS NOT THERE. THE COLD, SUFFOCATING DARK GOES ON FOREVER, AND WE ARE ALONE. LIVE OUR LIVES, LACKING ANYTHING BETTER TO DO. DEVISE REASON LATER. BORN FROM OBLIVION; BEAR CHILDREN. HELLBOUND AS OURSELVES; GO INTO OBLIVION. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE. EXISTENCE IS RANDOM. HAS NO PATTERN SAVE WHAT WE IMAGINE AFTER STARING AT IT FOR TOO LONG. NO MEANING SAVE WHAT WE CHOOSE TO IMPOSE.

WHY SHOULD CORPORATION WISH TO KILL COSTUME HEROES? CONTROLLED BY SOME OLD ENEMY PERHAPS? BUT THEN, WHO HAS REASON FOR TRIGGERING ARMAGEDDON? WE HAVE SO FEW POINTERS. INSANITY WOULD SEEM ONLY MOTIVE. SOMEONE WISHES TO DESTROY WORLD, REMOVES HEROES TO PREVENT THEIR INTERVENTION. SOMEONE TERMINALLY ILL, PERHAPS... HUHN. MOLOCH BETTER SUSPECT THAN PREVIOUSLY APPARENT. PITY DECEASED... UNLESS PLOT FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE, PREARRANGED...? NO, TOO FANTASTIC. EGYPTIAN DECOR COLORING LOGIC... RECOGNIZE
 DOG-HEADED BUST. ANUBIS, WATCHER OVER DEAD. WHOLE CULTURE DEATH-FIXATED, OBSESSIVELY SECURING THEIR TOMBS AGAINST INTRUDERS... DIDN’T LIKE THOUGHT OF CORPSES INTERFERED WITH. CAN’T AFFORD TO BE SO SQUEAMISH. DISTURBING DEAD OUR JOB. NEED TO UNEARTH FACTS CONCERNING MURDERS: BLAKE’S AND JACOBI’S. IF THAT OFFENDS ANUBIS, TOO BAD. HANDLED WATCH DOGS BEFORE. HOWEVER, SEEMS INADVISABLE TO CONFRONT THIS ENEMY’S WATCH DOGS BEFORE CONSIDERING SITUATION CAREFULLY. CAGE IS LOGIC-PROBLEM. SIMPLY NEEDS APPLICATION OF INTELLIGENCE. MUST ADMIT, DESPITE PERSONAL DISLIKE, VEIDT’S ABSENCE UNFORTUNATE. ALLEGEDLY SMARTEST MAN ON EARTH COULD NO DOUBT HAVE PROVIDED SOME ANSWERS. NEED ANSWERS QUICKLY. WORLD ON VERGE OF APOCALYPSE. DEATH AND WAR ALREADY HERE. OTHER HORSEMEN CAN’T BE FAR BEHIND. FUNNY... ANCIENT PHARAOHS LOOKED FORWARD TO END OF WORLD: BELIEVED CADAVERS WOULD RISE, RECLAIM HEARTS FROM GOLDEN JARS. MUST BE CURRENTLY HOLDING BREATH WITH ANTICIPATION. UNDERSTAND NOW WHY ALWAYS MISTRUSTED FASCINATION WITH RELICS AND DEAD KINGS... IN FINAL ANALYSIS, IT’S US OR THEM.”... “DANIEL? FOUND SOMETHING?”... “BUT VEIDT WAS TARGET.”... “FINAL ENTRY? LEFT VEIDT’S OFFICE JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT. DREIBERG, CONVINCED VEIDT;S BEHIND EVERYTHING, IS SERIOUS ABOUT VISITING ANTARCTICA. OWLSHIP CAPABLE, APPARENTLY, BUT ARE WE? ASSUMING JOURNEY POSSIBLE, TRACKING HIM TO HIS LAIR ONLY OPTION. STILL FEEL UNEASY. UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY... HE COULD KILL US BOTH, THERE IN SNOW. NOBODY WOULD EVER KNOW... FIRST NIGHT IN NOVEMBER. I AM COLD TONIGHT. OFFICES BELOW, HEADSTONES MARKING DAILY GRAVES OF THOUSANDS. INSIDE, ACROSS CLOCK FACES, AS OBSERVED AS THOSE OF CELEBRITIES, HANDS COMMENCE FINAL LAPS. OBLIVION GALLOPS CLOSER, FAVORING THE SPUR, SPARING THE REIN. I THINK WE WILL BE GONE SOON. VEIDT IS FASTER THAN DREIBERG. PERHAPS FASTER THAN ME. RETURN FROM MISSION SEEMS UNLIKELY. THIS LAST ENTRY. WILL SHORTLY MAIL JOURNAL TO ONLY PEOPLE CAN TRUST. TELL DREIBERG I NEED TO CHECK MY MAILDROP. HE BELIEVES ME. IF READING THIS NOW, WHETHER I AM ALIVE OR DEAD, YOU WILL KNOW TRUTH: ‘WHATEVER PRECISE NATURE OF THIS CONSPIRACY, ADRIAN VEIDT RESPONSIBLE.’ HAVE DONE BEST TO MAKE THIS LEGIBLE. BELIEVE IT PAINTS DISTURBING PICTURE. APPRECIATE YOUR RECENT SUPPORT AND HOPE WORLD SURVIVES LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO REACH YOU, BUT TANKS ARE IN EAST BERLIN, AND WRITING IS ON WALL. FOR MY OWN PART, REGRET NOTHING. HAVE LIVED LIFE, FREE FROM COMPROMISE... AND STEP INTO THE SHADOW NOW WITHOUT COMPLAINT. RORSCHACH, NOVEMBER 1ST, 1985.”... “HOW MUCH FURTHER? SAID WE WERE
OVER ANTARCTICA HOURS AGO.”... “SENSIBLE MOVE. MAKE FINAL APPROACH LOW, BENEATH RADAR.”... “DANIEL... COMING IN TOO LOW TOWARDS CLIFFS... DON’T WISH TO INTERFERE WITH RUNNING OF SHIP BUT SHOULD PERHAPS PULL UP SHARPLY BEFORE...”... “DANIEL...”... “DANIEL, ENGINE JUST STOPPED.”... “SAID ENGINE JUST...”... “ENNK...”... “TWISTED ANKLE. NOTHING SERIOUS. LANDED ON IT BADLY NIGHT POLICE TOOK ME. HOW BAD IS DAMAGE TO SHIP?”... “FINE LIKE THIS.”... “USED THESE WHEN WE TOOK UNDERBOSS. REMEMBER RIDING ALONG SEWER.”... “YES. GOOD NIGHT. THINK OF IT OFTEN. AS I RECALL, CONTROLS SIMPLE; JUST TWO PEDALS AND STEERING COLUMN.”... “IF WE GET BACK.”... “UNTRUE. JUST ISN’T ANY OF KIND WE CAN USE. IF VEIDT TRULY ENGINEERING THIRD WORLD WAR, WE ARE APPROACHING HEART OF DARKNESS.”.. “RONCH RONCH RONCH INSANITY, PERHAPS?”... “WHAT? HURM.”... “PALM TREES, BURIED IN SNOW. DOESN’T MAKE SENSE.”... “NERVOUS?”... “CAN ASK VEIDT, WHEN WE FIND HIM.”... “NOTHING. SUBDUE HIM FIRST, IF POSSIBLE MAY NOT GET SECOND CHANCE. ASK QUESTIONS LATER.”... “HITLER WAS VEGETARIAN. IF BOTHERS YOU, LEAVE VEIDT TO ME. SUGGEST WE PROCEED QUIETLY FROM HERE.”... “BLAKE’S MURDER. YOU CONFESS?”... “SAID TELEPORTATION UNWORKABLE.”... “TAKE CAT AWAY, VEIDT. TAKE CAT AWAY AND FACE ME...”... “NO. TELLING TRUTH. LISTEN TO VOICE. HE DID IT.”... “HE DID IT. HALF NEW YORK. VEIDT, GET RID OF CAT.”... “HURRR...”... “NO. DON’T LET HIM ESCAPE. MUST STOP HIM. KILLED BLAKE. KILLED HALF NEW YORK.”... “JOKING, OF COURSE.”... “NO. NOT EVEN IN THE FACE OF ARMAGEDDON. NEVER COMPROMISE.”... “BACK TO OWLSHIP. BACK TO AMERICA. EVIL MUST BE PUNISHED. PEOPLE MUST BE TOLD.”... “HUHHH. OF COURSE. MUST PROTECT VEIDT’S NEW UTOPIA. ONE MORE BODY AMONGST FOUNDATIONS MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE. WELL? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DO IT.”... “DO IT!”
